</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, November 4th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Esteemed Excellency the Editor of what is
much widely read New York newspaper.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I am a Japanese Schoolboy age
35 years &amp; I come to this Free Country for some
following reason:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. To save up money for old age.</p>

<p>2. To learn so much I can.</p>

<p>3. To wait on table 14 hours Daily at Boarding
house of Mrs. C. W. O’Brien, honourable
lady.</p>

</div>

<p>I am not doing so to-day as I am Confined in
hospital enjoying much pain from brick-bat
wound sent to me by one American Patriot. Also
I am not attending school for some time.</p>

<p>If your Highness will permit such correspondence
I will ask some Question which I will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
answer myself so as to save too much trouble
for your valuable time. Thank you.</p>

<p>Some frequent Professors are asking the question
now: Will White Man and Yellow Man ever
mix? I answer Yes because I have knowledge
of the affair. They mix once in San Francisco,
they mix once in Vancouver. But such mixing
is not good-healthy for the human race because it
make broken glass, pistol-shot, outcry, militia
and many other disagreeable noises. Japanese
gentleman mix races with jiu jitsu, Irish gentleman
with gas-pipe. Those are both good ways to know.</p>

<p>I have heartfelt feel for American gentleman
because my Teacher tell me America and Japan
are Noble Allies. Are we not this? Hon.
Marquis Wm. Taft arrive to Tokyo to say these
truth. He state to Admiral Togo, “We are Noble
Allies,” and Admiral Togo response, “If we shall
not be Noble Allies we shall be Noble Liars.”
Tokyo is so happy that Rising Sun make tear-drop
falling on star-stripe banner. Banzai!</p>

<p>Excuse bad penmanship as Right Hand was
wounded by brick-bat from one Noble Ally
name Casey. Bottles was also used on head
which were unfortunate.</p>

<p>So happy Japanese! Japan has most Noble
Allies than any other country. France, England,
these dear Uniteds State, Germany, Australia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
Switzerland, Spain, Portugal are all to fight
in our behaviour. Also Corea. The most
strongest of our Allies must, therefore, be England
who gives day-and-night thought to making all
Japanese comfortable. London newspaper weep
for shame when San Francisco labour man drop
building material on head of Japanese gentleman.
London newspapers arrange their editorial full
with considerable pity. Yes, please. England
man loves Japanese man with much distinction
because both are brothers by germ, are they not?
Also affinities.</p>

<p>My cousin Nogi become recently absentee from
San Francisco because he might reside away from
the brick-bats. He went to inhabit in British
Columbia at Vancouver to work in the Kakemono
Barber Shop under the so glorious British banner.
This is protection for all weak persons. I am
therefore much more ill in my sick hand when I
read this telegraph from my cousin Nogi.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging"><i>To Hashimura Togo, San Francisco</i>:</p>

<p>Welcome to Canada by Noble Allies. Three killed, seven
wounded. All well. Please send shot gun.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nogi.</span></p>

</div>

<p>I think so continuously concerning my cousin
enjoying trouble from that cordial Great Britain
that I am about to make hara-kiri by swallowing
bottle of hospital-medicine; but I relieve my death<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
more easily by making the following poetical
thought which I mailed to the King of England
who lives in London:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span></p>
<p>I am still awaiting Answer to this poetical
thought which must be there somewhere in English
postoffice soon.</p>

<p>Why do Japanese Boy come to this country is
requested for reply from almost every white mind
of prominence. I will answer with several reason
from my own vocabulary:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. To learn religion, Bookkeeping &amp;
Stenography.</p>

<p>2. To cement that Friendship of nations and
keep grocery store.</p>

<p>3. To attend horse-racing contests.</p>

<p>4. To learn American Manners</p>

<p>5. To study Customs, Murders, Art, Science, &amp;
Humoristic Literature from sunday papers.</p>

<p>6. To go back to Japan.</p>

</div>

<p>Perhaps you read in newspaper sometime rather
recently about a warfare which we enjoyed with
our Honourable Ally Russia which we cause to
love us with a bayonet. Your Emperor, Mr.
Roosevelt, then taught us how the peace may be
manufactured and we have done so ever since.
If you did not read of this in papers I will send
you clippings from the <i>Shimbun</i> of Tokyo.
We are sending the glad hand of fellowship
around to all white persons, but I can not do so
this week because the brick-bat wound I said to
you about is in my right wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>Before enjoying that painful collision I spoke
something with Hon. Strunsky, the Delegate who
Walks for the Unions. Some of my countrymen
has seen Hon. Strunsky Walk, but he has been
Setting down on them occasions seen by me. I
went there with ceremony before Mr. Strunsky at
his saloon, because he is Irish and makes angry
sudden.</p>

<p>“Please,” I enquiry, “let Japanese Boy to
plumbing union. I am able to plumb with
intelligence.”</p>

<p>“You make me tired,” he retorted back.</p>

<p>“Esteemed sir, if you are exhausting yourself
with fatigue let Japanese Boy have your job.
My cousin is ambitious for such a situation.”</p>

<p>“Beat it!” response Hon. Strunsky.</p>

<p>I could not assimulate that word he said it.</p>

<p>“What should he beat?” was question for me.</p>

<p>“You beat yourself around block—skiddoo!”
explained honourable Delegate gentleman.</p>

<p>When he was explaining these things in war-cry
voice so all could understand Mr. Carbonetti,
an American gentleman, struck me on the wrist with
a small piece of House which was not then built.
I spoke “Banzai!” and Mr. I. Rogo, proprietor
of the Rising Sun Coffee House, came with leaps
and make jiu jitsu upon Mr. Carbonetti while
O. Takura, my cousin’s grandfather, stopped Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Strunsky’s speeches with some kindling-wood.
Soon there was rain of brick-bats from sky and
Japanese Boys present much regretted they did
not wear any umbrella.</p>

<p>That is some ways it happened.</p>

<p>Was it then wise for the Delegate who Walks
for the Unions to say so? For was he not often
remarking there was no place for Japanese
gentleman in the American business? He does
not know the statistick like the Japanese statesman
may tell him. What does Ichipanorama,
Walt Whitman of Fuji, say so?</p>

<p>This is not exactly how Ichipanorama says
how, but something like so. America has room
for all. The Irish gentleman to hold the great
public offices, the Jewish gentleman to attend to
the drama and the clothing store, the Italian
gentleman to be the merchants with the fruit,
the German gentleman to attend to the large
sausage interests of the country. The Japanese
gentleman, then, what does he require in this
so great commonwealth? Sometimes something,
sometimes something different. To nail the
shoe, to write the books, to work in the gymnasium,
to run the banks, to peel potatoes, to govern the
states. Anywhere you require his usefulness he
will be so happy to be there.</p>

<p>Hoping your Highness understands plainly
to know how I think these things here, and love
to all.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HONOURABLE WAR CLOUD</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, November 16th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor of New York newspaper, enlightened
printer who manufacture Truth for all thoughtful
Person.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I so happy, thank you, esteemed
Mr., for you listen to how I say so in my last letter.
Therefore I am much obliged to you for several
more intelligent Question which I will ask you
what is.</p>

<p>During my residence in Hospital to enjoy
brick-bat wound sent there by Labouring Union,
I give some large quantities of thought-attention
to future life. What business would be swiftest
for making success of it? Waiting on table-board
of Mrs. O’Brien, honourable lady, is repulsive
to proud Japanese Boy any more do. Which
would be better for me: To learn to be Christian
Missionary or to study for bookkeeping and
stenography? Both ways lead to good jobs.</p>

<p>My cousin Nogi, who return from British
Columbia leaving front teeth with English friends
there, say, “Missionary jobs are no longer needed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
for Japan, because our dear country already
have rapid-fire fleet and stand-up army sufficient
to make all Japanese Christians.”</p>

<p>“What date is arrange for this Japan-America
war to be shot off?” I ask for answer.</p>

<p>“Not yet but when!” response this Nogi making
eyewink, American salute.</p>

<p>“In such a warfare which kingdom would
beat it?” is next question for me.</p>

<p>“Frequently one and then some,” collapse
Nogi, who think as I do.</p>

<p>Therefore I still ask to know. Hon. Mr. Sir,
could you so courteously remind Japanese Boy
of exact date for such warfare? If there is any
announcement in your press of this battle would
you send me clipping, address Hospital? Such
an answer would be delightful to know for all-coloured
races. Political man, labour-union
man, newspaper-press all have brain-ache questioning,
When. You will permit me, please, to
speak how I think so?</p>

<p>Japan-America war is impossible to happen!
Banzai! All should be so happy in Hon. Carnegie
talking-library at Hague. Philippine Island must
be taken by Japan on mortgage or some other
peaceable conquest. Perhaps American Congress
will consider this nice birthday present to
Emperor of Japan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>How I make this knowledge? Because so.
Japan could never secure these United States
entirely for Japanese Government. I. Anazuma,
Japanese barber, tell me how Mr. Kuroki might
not capture New York from such great distance
of San Francisco. And what must Japan do with
New York when captured? That is hard question
for Japanese Boy.</p>

<p>While residing in Hospital bed my cousin
Nogi come to me bringing donation of banana-fruit
for lunching. These fruit come as package
enwrapped in American newspaper-press. I am
thankful for lunch, but more so thankful for
reading-news on enwrapping. The information
tell me nervously that fleet of ships commanded
by Hon. Pres. Roosevelt will go around to the
Pacific ocean by the Cape of Horn, avoiding
Panama canal which is less done. Must Japan
shoot American ship for going to Pacific ocean?
This is question for editor. I answer, No, please!
Pacific ocean still have too much water for Japan
to cover with torpedo boats. Thank you, America
fleet may call at San Francisco, San Diego, Seattle
without angry rage from Tokyo government
which is busy civilizing Corea. Hon. Mr. Roosevelt
is welcome to travel.</p>

<p>Howeverly is, some sinful thoughts come to
Japanese Boy. Is not some excitement interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to all-coloured races? It would be fine
engagement for Japan-America navies to come
together sometime for slight shooting-scrape,
because both have enjoyed very pleasant target-practice.
America navy recently use boat of Hon.
Adm. Cervera for excellent bull’s eye. Japanese
navy practice, still more recently, on fleet of
Hon. Mr. Rodjestvensky in which practice Japan
gunners score 97 out of possible 100 hits. Yet it
are not good-healthy for 2 such equal navies to
meet in angry rage, because they might be
bursted by following brutal diagram:</p>

<p>Mr. Editor I am Samurai, like all other
Japanese Boys. When sick hand is well I am
good for all fights. My friend, Arthur
Kickahajama, missionary boy, is exceptional to
this rule saying man-strangling and dynamite
explosion to be bad for human race. He
teach meek-eye as best disease for strong-arm.
He come to Hospital and hold my sick hand
to say,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>“Togo, when union labour drop brick-bat upon
Japanese Boy, what then?”</p>

<p>“Hara-kiri!” I explain. “Japanese Boy
deliver jiu jitsu upon eye of Mr. Casey.”</p>

<p>“So heathen thought!” devote Arthur. “When
brick-bat smite left cheek, right cheek is then
presentable for more.”</p>

<p>To such talk I am only able to speak of rats.
Arthur forgive such politeness and read me
poetical thought, because sickness prevent escape:</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, your honourable country enjoys
many bad traits which are loathsome to Japanese.
You are disagreeable to old age, you neglect to
worship the holy relic. In the American household
you worship the recent Baby with doctors,
nurses, chloroform, etc., and at the tooth-cut of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
same all have spasms by joy. But when
Grandparent injures the appendicitis he must
enjoy it quietly in hospital with stationary to
make will.</p>

<p>In boarding house of Mrs. O’Brien there is one
young lady which all other eaters at the table-board
call “Grandma” because of her immense
age. All young gentlemen there talk humoristical
anecdote, smile, eat candy with young ladies of
more recent birth. While youthly ladies are doing
this Miss Grandma set lonesome by lamplight
reading Mrs. Humply Ward book.</p>

<p>I have often noticed these when seated in kitchen
studying American grammar. “Why should not
Young Lady be object of pious regard because
of great age?” I frequently enquire for answer.</p>

<p>One evening I put on frockaway coat and make
call to Miss Grandma.</p>

<p>“Hon. young lady,” I refer, “yes, ma’am,
excuse me, sir! Would you tell one questioning
to Japanese Boy?”</p>

<p>“Surely, Mister Togo,” she response. “Whatever
is?”</p>

<p>“Oftenly” I relate, “I am attractive to your
honourable notice setting lonesome under lamplight.
May I call sometime for lonesome
company?”</p>

<p>“You are kind gentleman, Mister Togo,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
she beseech. “Yes, you can come often for lonesome
call.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” I say, “you are regardless.
I come so often kitchen duties prevent it.”</p>

<p>She give me smiling expression peculiar to
American lady of any oldness.</p>

<p>“Tell me this answer,” she inquisitive softly.
“What qualities in myself make you such
admiration?”</p>

<p>“I admire you because of Japanese,” I response.
“For in Japan we are taught to reverence the Old
Age.”</p>

<p>She throw Humply Ward book to me, then
strike me with lamp-light. Fire extinguished by
means of Persian rug I retire to kitchen to make
my soul enquire about things.</p>

<p>Hoping your Highness may place this thoughts
on printing-press without danger, and love to
family and friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Printer</span>—I am enjoying great poverty
from employment which is missing this week,
thank you.</p>

<p>This conversation for you to listen:</p>

<p>“Mr. Togo, goodbye, and be prompt in doing
so!” That spoken with screeches by Mrs. C. W.
O’Brien, honourable lady.</p>

<p>“Sweet-hearted Mrs. Madam,” I resume
to her, “why you neglect to allow Japanese
Boy any more wait on table-board at your
establishment?”</p>

<p>“Because this,” she demand, “lazy stupor of
brain unfit Japanese Boy for such jobs. During
three weeks of time you remain in hospital to enjoy
pain. You think of book study more than delivering
soup to my table-eaters. Some others must
carry coffee-dish for this employment. Therefore
exit from these house!”</p>

<p>“Thank you to know, Hon. Mrs.,” I report,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
“what person shall obtain job when I have went
from here?”</p>

<p>“One China boy I have got him more intelligent
as you for half price to do it,” she refer.</p>

<p>I see plain truth to this. Looking to kitchen I
observe Whang So, one China boy of sinful profile.
I make race-riot inside of me, but peace-treaty
outside.</p>

<p>“Honourable Mrs. O’Brien,” I say with smiling
expression, “good day, so sorry, thank you so
much!” Then I make quick-step to sidewalk and
trot-step to establishment of Jigo Furo, Japanese
hardware.</p>

<p>“Thank you for something durable to handle,”
I say to this Jigo Furo.</p>

<p>“This stove-poker is recommended for all use,”
he response. It surely was truthful. I take it
away for call on Mr. Whang So, China boy of
sinful profile. He come to door of Mrs. C. W.
O’Brien when asked for.</p>

<p>“Whang So, Chinese puppy-cat, wherefore you
have national characteristics of one potato?” I
relapse.</p>

<p>“You go way, no good!” he reserve with impolite
expression of Oriental.</p>

<p>For reply I throw stove-poker to neck of Whang
So, give him jiu jitsu to porch and tie him with
abominable pig-tail to door knob of Mrs. C. W.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
O’Brien where he may be found. This things I
done to Whang So as race-riot to Chinese persons
which is no good for America by following statistick:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. They perform cleanly-washing infrequently.</p>

<p>2. They are back-hand in religion, reform,
bookkeeping and stenography.</p>

<p>3. They teach poker game to Japanese Boy.</p>

<p>4. They are a Yellow Peril.</p>

</div>

<p>I have given some brain-study to this Yellow
Peril to make sure it is a bad blessing for these
Uniteds State. It is. But should we Americans
of all-colour enjoy fear of such? Answer is, No!
Coreans, Chinese, &amp; Hindus is Yellow Peril. All
Japanese can defeat these easily with club-stick.
We have been there to try it. If white Caucasian
fear such a Peril Japanese will promise to chase it
away for small wage-pay. It will be amusement
for Japanese Boy who know how.</p>

<p>All persons should be kept out of this kingdom
who can not show good-coloured complexions at
ship-dock. Torpedo-fleet, battle-boat, dynamite
&amp; congress should be shot off to prevent landing
of such trash like Mr. Whang So and other Chinese
of yellow birth. Coreans, Siamese, &amp; Hindus must
also be prevented from escaping into this country.
Christian ships must take these complexions back
to original islands where they belongs. This is
best good for all human races.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>Many negro persons of Southern States is
also Yellow Peril, but these can not enjoy
exclusion, because there is no place to exclude
them to.</p>

<p>But Japanese gentleman, please, must not be
written down for this list. Derby hat, American
pant, Tuxedo overcoat, have rendered him completely
white of complexion and able to vote for
President when asked to know how. Please do
not include him in Yellow Peril, because he will
not be there. He is doing things by each day that
makes folks white. Let Japanese help to do push-out
to all-coloured Yellow Perils coming to this
country together with others patriots of star-stripe
banner Yankee-doodle dandy, banzai!</p>

<p>I will speak to you of two Yellow Perils which
I know of my knowledge.</p>

<p>I am acquaintance of one Corean gentleman
name of Whee who reside in cellar of this city.
He do not change his clothing which is economical.
He sleep in soap-box, but the soap is missing.
To approach Mr. Whee with hygiene is too dangerous
for good healthy. Labouring Union do not
fear this Corean gentleman, because he shall
never take no work from nobody. When not
hitting pipe-smoke this Whee man is dreaming
of ancestors. He will also be one soon. When I
observe such Corean patriot approaching to me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
I choose next street, thank you. This man is
Yellow Peril of bright colour.</p>

<p>In one more cellar, close to where this Corean
citizen reside, there sleep one Polish gentleman
name of Gumowsky. This Gumowsky man is
notable for forgetfulness in washing. Two times
each year he is removed by health Board, but this
is of no use for Mr. Gumowsky who make financial
income collecting second-handed cigarettes.
When he obtain sufficient whiskey-drunk there is
warcry from his downstairs residence and whichever
furniture he can discover to break is throwed
on street to strike by-passing pedestrians. Mr.
Gumowsky is not good gentleman to inhabit this
American country. He is a Yellow Peril of dark
colour, because soiled.</p>

<p>Which is more better citizen, thank you—Mr.
Whee of opium smoking and Gumowsky of
whiskey-drunking or Japanese Boy of derby hat,
frockaway coat and all other white manners of
civilizedation?</p>

<p>On evening time of last Thursday night Japanese
branch of Chinese Exclusion League meet for
church social at Asiatic M. E. Church where good
time were enjoyed there. My cousin Nogi took as
escort Miss Mabel Sanjijo who he are engaged to
marry when divorced. I delivered to this gaiety
Miss Alice Furioki pleasant young lady of yellow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
extraction. All Japanese Boys was present with
other national ladies. Rev. Hon. Chillworthy,
American missionary, make all happy by coming
late.</p>

<p>Japanese Boy Male Quartette open excitement
by songing, “I love you the same long years ago
when first I meet you on the village green.” Songing
listened at with patience by all. Japanese
solo was next performed on phonograf. Arthur
Kickahajama, missionary boy, do card-trick for
excitement of amusement. Then we enjoy “post-office”
game to practise kissing, American salute.
When this was subsided I made so nervous as to
read following poetickal thought:</p>

<h3><i>ADDRESS TO CONGRESS ABOUT STOP-OFF OF

it about “Higher Life for Japanese Boy” when
something happen which was too bad. Whang So,

<p class="hanging"><i>Editor New York newspaper who enjoys great
delight while reading all poetry &amp; story
writings which he send back to Author with
smiling excuses</i>:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>—What say that great poeter,
Hon. Sir Walter Scotch, about ladies? He say
as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O ladies, during idle moments</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Inclined to make coyness with giggly expression,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Yet when sick-sorrow time of brain-ache come along</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">You are very skilful about being an Angel!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Since my loving engagement to Miss Alice
Furioki I got good chance to study them Ladies.</p>

<p>Ladies, Mr. Editor, is nearly always female by
sex. This is a very universal custom. Therefore,
since original date of Eve &amp; Adam ladies of female
gander has been accustomed to drudgeness and
downtroddery all time. Ladykind has been slave
of gentlemankind from 1 o’clock of history to
present date; they has been personal dry-goods of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
them tyrants of male descent without no privileges
except following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. To tell husband what-time to get up by
morning.</p>

<p>2. To demand him, Why no come home earlier
by evenings?</p>

<p>3. To require, “What drunk are you carrying
on breath?”</p>

<p>4. To save wages for him by spending it.</p>

<p>5. To take him to theatrical plays for educating
of brain.</p>

<p>6. To select more fashionable friends for him.</p>

<p>7. To explain to him when he is foolish in
business.</p>

<p>8. To select Presidents, Congressmen, Mayors,
etc., for which he must vote it.</p>

</div>

<p>After doing them slavery for such numberous
1000s of year, all human ladies is suddenly enjoying
angry rage about them downtroddery. They
wish to do some poll-voting for therselves, because
husbands is frequently forgetful about how to do
it; and thus wrong persons is often elect to be
President.</p>

<p>So considerable Suffergetting is being did by
ladies who learn to do it.</p>

<p>Suffergetting immigrate to this U. S. by boat
from London where it is always spoken with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
English accent, or it is bogus and cannot be
admitted to respectable jails. Any young lady of
35 years time can learn to Suffergette if she is quiet
about it and listen to speaker while she is being
arrested. This is how to do it most often:</p>

<p>English lady of name Mrs. Wellington Boots
arrive to America dressed silently in pink opera
cloak with white ostrich in hat. She proceeds
herself quietly to Carnegie library, beating tunes
on bass drum for fear someone might notice her.
On steps of that learned bookery she array her
feetsteps and make following speech:</p>

<p>“Oh!!”</p>

<p>With immediate quickness platoon of police
make military formation, reserves is brought out,
still alarm for State Militia and half-holiday is
called in all dressmakers’ establishments. Delegates
arrive from Daughters of Rebecca, Neices
of American Revolution, little Mothers’ Association,
etc. while Hon. Mrs. Boots pull herself to
complete tallness and say,</p>

<p>“Fellow Sisters, let us arise up and smite it!
Already we are ten million strong, and I see Congressman
Carrie Jones approaching with 4 nurse-girls
and 2 lady-cashiers, which makes us 6 stronger
than we was. Let us forward, then, to Liberty
or somewhere. Let us make such a race-riot
around that Gentleman Tyrant that Heaven shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
be punctuated with screams and Earth shall be
scattered with hairpins.”</p>

<p>So procession of Lady Suffergettes make forward
motion in publick street. Following is line
of marching which they keeps:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>First Division.</i> Hon. Mrs. Boots, Judge Ethel
Johnson, Congressmen Carrie Jones &amp; Lily
McGee, Major Gen. Birdie Chowinsky. These
eminent statesladies is mounted on red automobiles
and carry one delicious canary-colour Suffergette
flag embroideries of organization-motto “Dux et
Draco” and trimmed with tucks and real Irish
lace.</p>

<p><i>Second Division.</i> Composed of Salvation Army
ladies’ Cornet Band which is playing “Every
Day is Ladies’ Day with Us.”</p>

<p><i>Third Division.</i> Woman’s Temperance Race
Suicide Union carrying motto “Let the Men Bear
the Children!”</p>

<p><i>Fourth Division.</i> Representators of the ex-Housewives’
Association in carriages saying something
serious to each others.</p>

<p><i>Fifth Division.</i> Cavalry Troup of Lady Cowboys
giving examples of rude riding.</p>

<p><i>Sixth Division.</i> One Gentleman Suffergette
on foot burdened with motto “A Man’s a Man
for a’ That.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p><i>Seventh Division.</i> Patrol wagons full of policemans
with dutiful expressions.</p>

</div>

<p>After they have did some ½ hour of marching,
enthusiastick, etc., Congressman Carrie Jones say
to Hon. Mrs. Boots, “Where shall we go to demand
it?”</p>

<p>“Let us gone to Parliament,” decry this Mrs.
Boots who know how-so to do it in England.</p>

<p>“So sorry not to do!” collapse several ladies in
unicorn. “We have not got a Parliament in this
town.”</p>

<p>“Such an irritant! what a nation!” deploy Hon.
Mrs. Boots. “Then let us gone to City Hall.”</p>

<p>So ice-cream soda refreshment is enjoyed by all
and procession makes onwards to City Hall where
it stops itself. Loud rapping on door of this
temple by all present.</p>

<p>“No admittance to come in!” say voice which is
inside trembling.</p>

<p>“We require to see Hon. Mayor so that we can
receive our rights, please,” says Mrs. Boots with
accent.</p>

<p>“No goods delivered till after lunch, thank
you,” say that voice from inside. “Hon. Mayor is
outside eating it.”</p>

<p>“Then let us have Dist. Attorney, please!”
peruse that chorus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“No, ma’am, not to do!” dictate voice. “Hon.
Dist. Attorney is outside drinking it.”</p>

<p>(Patrol wagons stand by with respectable
salutes.)</p>

<p>Loud reports from all lady Suffergettes. Forward
march! Door is smashy open and all mingle
inside that City Hall filling it with female political
noises. Mayor office is found vacated. Nothing
in Hon. Dist. Attorney office except empty arm-chairs.
Marriage Licence Bureau locked with key.
Nothing to resemblance of Man is discovered
inside that City Hall.</p>

<p>But No! One timid gentleman is found in City
Treasury office hiding in safe. It is the Janitor
who is praying with voice, “Please to avoid injury
me—I am married to a wife.”</p>

<p>Janitor is permitted to go free, thank you,
because of female relations. Meeting is then held
in office. Hon. Mrs. Boots is elect Mayor <i>pro tem.</i>
till arrival of Chief of Police when all enjoy arrest
and is taken to Hon. Jail.</p>

<p>At Hon. Jail Hon. Mrs. Boots, Judge Ethel
Johnson and Major Gen. Birdie Chowinsky is
given comfortable cell on Murderers’ Row along
with 6 Insurance Directors, 3 Congressmen, 1
Mayor, and 1 Boy Millionaire who shot
another gentleman under very fashionable circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>Tea is served in cell and lady Suffergettes receive
all-kind friends which come to congratulate them
about being there. American jails is becoming too
exclusive of lately. Persons must be very rich
or very famous, or else talented in some other way,
to be locked up with all them there financiers.</p>

<p>Every time I see patrol wagon making gallop-off
to jail I am excited to know if it is full of Suffergettes
or if it contain another load of Trust Co.
Presidents.</p>

<p class="tb">I tell my cousin Nogi about that Suffergette
procession the same I told you about.</p>

<p>“It can not be true, because it isn’t,” he commit
for pride.</p>

<p>“Why-so not so?” I recoil of contempt for short
intelligence.</p>

<p>“Because thus,” he say it, “because in this
America no real lady can get arrested for nothing
she does, no matter how much she does it.
America mans is weak from chivalry whenever
their wifes &amp; grandmothers needs to be arrested.
Besides something more. Would Hon. Gov.
Hughes arrest 1,000 ladies for going to Albany with
request, please, to be allowed to vote for him?
Would Hon. Jo-uncle Cannon ring for police-cart
because Suffergettes bust into Congress to exclaim,
‘We want ballot-box to fill-up with sympathy for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Jo-uncle Cannon?’ Would them candidates call
for law to protect gray hairs from this? Answer is,
No! Votes is votes, whether they got skirts on or
something else. Washington is a very comfortable
place for persons of either gander or sex to go asking
for privilege to vote; for nearly everybody is a
candidate in Washington.”</p>

<p>“Nogi, you are accused of being a Suffergette!”
I collapse for disgust.</p>

<p>“I am not-so that,” renig this Nogi with blushes,
“but Miss Mabel Sanjijo enjoys such a membership.”</p>

<p>“Will she join lady-excursion to Suffergette in
Washington on March 3?” is next question
for me.</p>

<p>“Yes-so—if she can borrow it for carfare,”
this from Nogi. “If she can not do she will stay
at home &amp; give Hon. Pres. Roosevelt absent
treatment.”</p>

<p>“Will Hon. Pres. Roosevelt add Suffergette
plank to Hon. Republican platform?” I ask to
know.</p>

<p>“O probably yes-so!” say Nogi. “He have
added everything else to that platform. Why-so
should he pause at them ladies?”</p>

<p>“What did Suffergette Delegation which visited
Albany bring back from that tour?” I decry.</p>

<p>“They brung back souvenir photo representing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
one Statesman peeking through brush-heap. On
this was wrote, ‘Choose Hughes &amp; You Can not
Lose,’ This was took as good-luck sign for all
Suffergettes.”</p>

<p>I am disgust of so much back-talk.</p>

<p>“One last reply I make,” I say. “Female
ladies can not make success of it in middle of
Politicks. Shall we send old women to U. S.
Senate?”</p>

<p>“Why not-so?” negotiate Nogi. “If Hons.
Platt &amp; Depew remain there so long will 1 or 2
extra old ladies be conspicuous for notice?”</p>

<p>Here is some delicious poem for you to abuse:</p>

<span class="smaller">THE FINANCIAL BREAKDOWN</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, January 9th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper, whichever
gentleman or gentlemans does such useful
work there.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Mr. Sir</span>—This U. S. Kingdom, Mr.
Editor, is now at present enjoying great panic
of banking business. I do not participate in this
calamity, because I am making less salary than
required for banking surplus. Therefore I am not
objecting to present money shake-down except
because I have none, and yet frequently I hear
of stock-jump falling down grade until it is
broken and useless for finance. Yes, also several
banking-business go under. “Under what?”
is question for me. For reply I hear each get-poor
gentleman say “Wall Street,” pointing to
Augustus Heinz on map.</p>

<p>This thoroughfare, Wall Street, must be magnificent
place for some persons to enjoy. My
Cousin Nogi explain how about that avenue.
“That is very rich place for gilding,” he response,
“each sidewalk there is paved with gold money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
which broker gentlemen do not care for. Stock
exchange and many banking establishments there
are constructed solidly of gold-brick.”</p>

<p>“Nogi,” I relate, “you often know something.
Thank you to answer 5 questions which I have
prepared upon letter-paper for reply.”</p>

<p>“Relate such troubles to some editors,” say
Nogi taking derby to go call on Miss Mabel Sanjijo
which he is engaged to marry when divorced.
Therefore I supply those 5 questions about
Financial trouble for you to look at, Mr. Sir:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. When Stocks makes upstart motion why
do it act so rather than stand stationary?</p>

<p>2. When Stocks makes downstart movement,
what for is the reason and what would stop it?</p>

<p>3. Some gentlemen is called “broker”—what
does he break to get such names?</p>

<p>4. When money is lost in Wall St. can this be
recovered by advertising in newspaper?</p>

<p>5. Can you give Japanese Boy name and
address of some honourable gentleman who might
tell accurately what time some stocks will be
making upstart movement soon?</p>

</div>

<p>Why do bank-houses burst? That is more
easy answer than those questions about Wall St.
jumping of stocks. Banks burst because there
is nothing inside and pressure from outside
causes cave in of walls. Why is there nothing in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
banks when so bursted? Because persons makes
runnings on these banks in order to take outside
what is inside. Maybe one man have $1,000 in
this bank-house. He go around to that place
to see if these money is comfortable there.</p>

<p>“Is my thousand dollar remaining comfortable
in this deposit?” he require of Hon. Pay-Teller.</p>

<p>“Yes, please,” respond this Financier, “all
such moneys is right deposited where put.”</p>

<p>“Thanks to know, Mr. Banker,” retort
American gentleman. “If you please, permit
me to carry it from places to places in my pocket
which I have.”</p>

<p>“You are obliged to it,” demand them Pay-Teller,
and take $1,000 from deposit, where was, to
pocket of American gentleman, where is. Soonly
numberous American gentlemans learn about
take-out of $1,000, so all make running-stampede
to bank-house where they say to Pay-Teller:</p>

<p>“Give <i>us</i> each $1,000 to carry from places to
places in <i>our</i> pockets which we have in our
clothes!”</p>

<p>“You are obliged to it,” response the Pay-Teller.
So he deposit $1,000 to all persons until
bank-house bursts down and Wall St. enjoys
frequent panic of fear.</p>

<p>This show plainly that bank-houses bursting
is blame of people who do it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>Rich men enjoying poverty are much stabbed
by financial breaking. Poor men enjoying large
incomes of money are not so stung.</p>

<p class="tb">To avoid financial panic therefore persons
should have too much wealthy for this. How to
get this money is question for Japanese Boy.
How did each great American gentleman acquire
such millions? If Japanese Boy could know
how, he might follow example of Industry
Captains and get exhalted likewise. So I put
on my derby to discover about this success in
business.</p>

<p>To Hon. Mr. Strunsky who keep saloon I go
with enquiry. Like all Irish gentlemen Mr.
Strunsky is sweethearted when not enjoying
angry fit.</p>

<p>“Tell me to know, Hon. Strunsky,” I examine,
“how do this Rockefeller acquire such many
things?”</p>

<p>“He is successful in grafting,” response Mr.
Strunsky.</p>

<p>“Thank you to response how Hon. Harriman
also do so?” I talk.</p>

<p>“He is fine grafter,” suggest this Irish
gentleman.</p>

<p>“In what profession do Hon. Hill, Hon. Lawson
&amp; Hon. Rodgers train themselves for it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<p>“Graft!” response Mr. Strunsky making
blinking motion of eye.</p>

<p>Thanks so much to Mr. Strunsky I go away
improved. I have now choosen career to which
I shall apply my mental thought. Grafting
profession is good thing for Japanese Boy to learn
because this lead to famous success and renown
in American life. Maybe I go back Japan and
teach this knowledge in University of Tokyo.</p>

<p>To become great famous like Rockefeller, etc.,
must require so much book-study of grafting.
Where to get such books? Walter W. Shoji,
who study learning at California university, say
that grafting is sometime teached by professors
together with law-courses. I go to S. F. public
library &amp; there find volumes about farming,
architecture, warfare, arithmetic, socialism &amp;
religion, but no book to tell how grafting should
be done by a beginner wishing to do so.</p>

<p class="tb">Many persons speak of Hon. Abe Reuff, now
residing in jail, as grafter. This do not be so.
Grafters are famous gentlemen, and therefore
must be great &amp; good. This Hon. Reuff is not
so, for why would he be there in that jail then?
He is so caged up for dishonestness. I would not
study grafting of dishonest man, because he
might not teach me right. What did Wm.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
Shakespeare, the great book-maker, say so? “Act
well your part, others take notice.”</p>

<p>Hon. Sir, do you pay cash-money for poetical
thought like following rhythm?</p>

<p>Arthur Kickahajama, missionary boy, come
me to-day and make tearful cries because I have
decided to be Grafter instead of learning missionary
job. When he know that I am firmtooth to
my purpose he tell me this story about antique
Japan:</p>

<p>Seven million years previously to the present
Japan dynasty the great philosopher Nichi
Nichi sat down to make fishing-sport by small
stream-creek of Yeddo. While engaged in putting
angly-worm bait on fish-hook he look down
in stream-creek and observe twelve thousand
sucker-fish in water making eye-wink at angly-worm
bait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“This would be remarkable luck for Japanese
fisherman,” he respond, dipping angly-worm in
puddle. But sucker-fish no care for diet just then
and perch on bottom making smiles through gills.</p>

<p>Nichi Nichi is excited by obstinacy of sucker-fish.
He put on caterpillar-bait. Nothing to do.
He try corn-beef diet for fishes. They refusal,
thank you. He spit on bait to bring favour of
fish-god. Sucker-fish not care for this pains-taking,
howeverly.</p>

<p>Then philosopher Nichi Nichi enjoy angry rage
throwing fish-pole to grass, tearing beard and
speeching these:</p>

<p>“O tell me, sucker-fish, is it not truth that you
are reputed most easy of all fish that practise
swimming in these brook near Yeddo?”</p>

<p>And them twelve thousand sucker-fish, making
smiles through gills, raise fins to universal sky
and response,</p>

<p>“Oh Nichi Nichi, philosopher, we are that.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me to know, idiotic waggle-tails,
why you no care for delicious baits I provide for
eating?”</p>

<p>“Because this,” reject all them fish together
flipping tails to dog-star, “we have ate them baits
before—caterpillar, angly-worm, corn-beef—we
have ate and been catched by those. Never again,
thank you so much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, quite well!” exclamation that great man.
“Then I shall offer you some new rare bait
which fishes shall eat only this once time, because
so scarce to get.”</p>

<p>With these remark the wise Nichi Nichi take
all baits off from hook. Then he drop bare hook
in stream. All them sucker-fish cease to smile
with gills and make hungry grab at hook, because
this (they thinked to themselves) was such rare
chance.</p>

<p>As consequence of this excitement Nichi Nichi
catch 12,000 sucker-fish in 1 hour 20 minutes.
These he made into canned salmon and grow very
wealthy from such a Graft.</p>

<p>At time of death-bed he remarked to wife and
children, “It would be sinful to waste good Bait
on poor Fishes.”</p>

<p>So this proverb is pasted on all important
Japanese tombs today:</p>

<p>“The gods have fixed the little brooks so that
one sucker-fish is born each minute by clocktime.
Who shall catch him, you or I?”</p>

<p>Hoping your printing-factory is doing good
by all news and best wishes to friends,</p>

<span class="smaller">HON. NIGGERS, WAS THEY FREED BY LINCOLN?</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Jan. 29th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper where Truth
is oftenly found on shrines &amp; Virtue sets in
very comfortable rocking-chair.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>—Japanese Schoolboys does not
addict therselves to gleeful laugh of mirth, because
some Noble Thought might escape away never to
be catched. What say American songer, Hon.
Seth Lowell, about almanac:</p>

<p>“What is so scarce as a day in June?”</p>

<p>Answer is: A Noble Thought is more scarcer!</p>

<p>And yet this morning-time I was uttering several
gleeful screams which was unavoidable to dodge.
Editorial of newspaper-print say, “Hon. Jo-uncle
Cannon must be voted for because of face which
have close shave to that of Hon. Abraham Lincoln.”
Then I was to blame for them mirthfulness
which almost-so cause race-riot in Japanese
section.</p>

<p>It has become fashionable in this kingdom,
Mr. Editor, for candidates wishing to become
President to resemble Hon. Abraham Lincoln so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
closely as possible to. This is frequently difficult.
Hon. Cannon is like Hon. Lincoln to roots of
whiskers, but them foliage does not indicate very
much about what is going on inside of soul.
Difference between Hon. Lincoln and Hon.
Cannon is difference between high-thinking and
high-tariff. Resemblance of them two great
Statesmen is only chin-deep. I. Anazuma, Japanese
barber, say-how that expressions of Hon.
Fairbanks &amp; Hon. Hughes could be changed by
trimming to make look-like of Hon. Lincoln. I
am alarmed to think. Perhaps-so that famous
globe-racer, Hon. Taft, might be also arranged
over in some way, but would he not lose considerable
solid Japanese vote in doing thus?
I am amazed to reply.</p>

<p>Maybe it would be more human-natural for
candidates wishing to enjoy election to hire from
some costumer following masquerade:</p>

<p>Hon. Cannon disguised as Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p>Hon. Taft disguised as Bismarck.</p>

<p>Hon. Hughes disguised as Viscount Aoki.</p>

<p>Hon. Cortelyou disguised as John Drew.</p>

<p>Hon. Bryan disguised as Elbert Hubbard.</p>

<p>Hon. Fairbanks disguised as Uriah Keep.</p>

<p>Them costumes might be payed for by Campaign
Contributions, but will they? Wall Street regard
bribing as sinful during depression of hard times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Before leaving off from Tokyo for these
Uniteds State I was considerably weeped
over by my Rev. Grandfather, Japanese of
elderly principles who say-so to me, “Togo,
you are going to that wild kingdom of America
which is very full of savage Christians. Do
not go to Indiana because Indians is found
there.”</p>

<p>“I am disgusted to think,” I commute. “What
shall I do in this America so as not to disgrace my
long row of ancestors?”</p>

<p>“Find yourself some Ideal,” corrode Hon.
Grandfather. “Make pickout of some famous
American what you can live up to them.
Select to be like George Washington, Abraham
Lincoln, or E. H. Harriman. Thank you to
choose.”</p>

<p>So I leave that dear ancestor to his rice-cake,
tea-drunk, hara-kiri and other old-fashion Japanese
customs and take Nippon Maru-boat for
America. When I arrive to wharf I meet Cousin
Nogi and enquire to know.</p>

<p>“Should Japanese Boy imitate performances
of Hon. E. H. Harriman in order to become
immediately immortal?”</p>

<p>“Too dangerous to do!” indicate this Nogi
with American eye-wink. “Hon. Harriman is
now being regulated by law.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>“How about Hon. Washington and Hon.
Lincoln to copy for famous career?” I magnetize
for emotion.</p>

<p>“Hon. Washington could not tell a lie, while
Hon. Lincoln was celebrated for gleeful anecdotes.
Therefore Lincoln was most ablest man of
them two. Also because of early struggly of
career he was noble example for all Japanese
Schoolboys enjoying poverty for American
education.”</p>

<p>Then Cousin Nogi, who is very addicted to
paragraphs of Hon. Ida M. Tarbell, tell me
following history of early Lincoln:</p>

<p>“When Hon. Abe Lincoln enjoy seven years of
oldness,” carouse this Nogi, “he desire to be President
of these Uniteds State which was then a
republick by government.</p>

<p>“‘How can you manage to be this President
and yet work on farm?’ his Rev. Mother enquire
to know.</p>

<p>“‘By running odd-jobs before times &amp; book-study
afterwards,’ molest this youthful enthusiasm
with smiling expression.</p>

<p>“So with immediate quickness he obtain job of
employment mowing grass, keeping books and
running elevator for neighbouring farmer. He
also tilled some soil for people. When not doing
this he was studying ‘How to Be President,’ a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
book by George Washington who was then enjoying
pension for oldness.</p>

<p>“In book-studies &amp; job-duties Hon. Lincoln
spend 24 hours daily. Balance of time was
devoted to recreations, sleep &amp; other idleness of
amusement. This continual drudgery of employment
teach that Lincoln many useful things,”
conduce Nogi at expiration of this history.</p>

<p>“Ah yes!” I collapse, “it teach him to sympathize
for them Negroes who was also enjoying
slavery.”</p>

<p>I am natural to ask question: Was it good thing
to request them Negroes to stop slaving? I have
required for reply of several Japanese about this
Negro Problemb, but they are unamerous to reply,
“We do not know any such coloured acquaintances,
thank you!” And they are proud about
it. I wrote letter of this Question to Hon. Booker
Washington who answered by sending C. O. D.
“How I Quit Being One,” a delightful volume
full of adjectives. How to know about Negro
Question then?</p>

<p>I at last become acquaintance of Hon. J.
Fortesque Smith, Negro-coloured gentleman who
does mop-work at saloon of Hon. Strunsky who
runs it. If all Negroes is like this Smith it must
be a talented race. So filled of expression is his
performances on Edison phonograph! With such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
raring pathos do he execute that famous negro
melody, “Cheerful Widow Waltz” from them
rubber disks! By hour I admire harmonious
noise of Hon. Smith and that talented machine—then
pretty soonly came around Hon. Strunsky
with angry Irish voice to command more purchase
of beer or get-out.</p>

<p>At last, Mr. Editor, I go around to grand opera
of Williams &amp; Walker, and there continue study
of Negro Problemb. I was very intelligent about
this until Hon. Johnson collapsed into raggle-time
sing-songing entitled “Sus-a-OO, Lu-Lu, I-a
want-a you too!” Suddenly I discover my feets
performing jiu jitsu with therselves under seat.
I rebuke them quietly, but they continue to
misbehave until, at finally, they strike dark
clergyman in ankle-bone and I am retired
from that opera house after considerable race-riot.</p>

<p>O surely, it is wrong for that Africa to teach
them diseases to Europe &amp; Asia! And yet that
raggle-time coon-singing is a species of chorus
which shoots a long distance into my soul. I am
very earnest about this dark-coloured harmony
which comes with such splandid spasms through
the shoes expressing comic emotions as it does so.
Could you send me name and address of some
talented Hon. Coon who would furnish tune, rimes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
jokes, etc., for following poetical thought? For
this he will receive ½ of what he gets.</p>

<span class="smaller">HON. SIMPLE LIFE AMONG AMBASSADORS</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, February 10th,</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper which tells all
Truth for second-class postage.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>—I ask to know. Would it be a
possibility for one bright Japanese Boy to get a
good salary position of Ambassador to Berlin or
some other seaport? My cousin Nogi tell me that
Dr. Dave Hill do not care for such a job because
wages is too tiny.</p>

<p>“How much is them wages?” I inquire for
nervous feeling.</p>

<p>“Sum of $17,500 of annual pay,” mortify this
Nogi.</p>

<p>“Japanese Boy would accept this patiently,”
I collapse with voice.</p>

<p>“He might got it, but could he?” dictate Nogi,
who understands horse-racing &amp; problembs.</p>

<p>I am beswitched.</p>

<p>“You would appear a very cheap diplomat with
such a salary,” say Nogi. “Hon. Charleymain
Tower, Ambassador from O-hio, spend more
annual cash than this for champagne which is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
necessary in Berlin for kings, dukes, princes, etc.,
which is accustomed to expect it from American
Ambassadors when going through that town.
That Hon. Tower are a great spend.”</p>

<p>“Poverty are no disgrace,” I signify with W. J.
Bryan expression.</p>

<p>“For Methodist Ministers it are no disgrace,”
say Nogi. “But for Foreign Ministers it are considered
a crime.”</p>

<p>“I am confused by this,” I depress.</p>

<p>“Imagine that you was Hon. American Ambassador
to Berlin,” deploy Nogi.</p>

<p>I do so with ease.</p>

<p>“And imagine I was Hon. Emperor of
Germany.”</p>

<p>I do so with difficulty.</p>

<p>“You go to them Germany with $17,500 annual
wages which you draw in advance. You look
around street for some nice palace where U. S.
flag can be represented with dignity. You find
such a palace, pretty soonly, over general
feed store for rent-sum of $20 per monthly.
For sum of $5 you can hire Mrs. Nusbaum in
up-floor flat to take down clothes-line so that
Hon. U. S. flag can be flew on Monday afternoon.
Then you spend $17,000 for champagne
and set down on back porch where flies are
scarce.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>“Do something happen pretty suddenly?” I ask
to know.</p>

<p>“Quite promptly I come along in one golden-coloured
automobile, accompanied by Signal
Corps, Fire Department, Royal Mounted Mustache
Guard, and Second Artillery Band——”</p>

<p>“Who are you, please?” is next question for
Japanese Schoolboy.</p>

<p>“I am Hon. Emperor of Germany calling to
make a diplomatick relationship with Hon.
American Ambassador. I call in them quiet way
I mention because I know that Hon. Poverty of
American Ambassador would get embarrassed by
kingly pompus. I stop royal automobile in front
of Nusbaum’s Feed Store.</p>

<p>“‘Are Hon. American Ambassador at home for
diplomatick relationship?’ Hon. Emperor holler-up
to second story.</p>

<p>“‘He are out back splitting kindling,’ decry
Hon. Mrs. Nusbaum. ‘But I will told him that
Your Majesty have arrive—wait, please!’</p>

<p>“So she run &amp; whistle down speaking-tube:</p>

<p>“‘Hello! Come up if convenient, Mr. Ambassador.
Hon. Emperor are here to see you.’</p>

<p>“So Hon. American Ambassador, with arms
full of kindling wood, make sneakstep to kitchen,
where he wash hands in sink, then haste to parlour.
There he find Hon. Emperor of Germany setting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
on sofa and looking cross because he have stumbled
over baby-buggy in the hall.</p>

<p>“‘Good morning, Mr. Emperor,’ say Hon.
Ambassador. ‘Will you have something to
drink?’</p>

<p>“‘No,’ say he. ‘But I will take a cigar.’</p>

<p>“‘I have not got no cigars, Hon. Majesty,’ he
say. ‘But I have some delicious chew-tobacco of
considerable long cut.’</p>

<p>“Hon. Emperor of Germany, who are a awful
polite king, eat some of that tobacco and make
faces of enjoyment. Soonly he accept drink
of champagne what Mrs. Nusbaum give him in
tin cup; then he prepare to take his depart with
willing smiles.</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Ambassador,’ he decry, ‘what kind of
Embassy do you call this what you got here?’</p>

<p>“‘This,’ say Hon. Ambassador, ‘are what are
called “Jeffersonian Simplicity.”’</p>

<p>“‘Are you fond of this kind of simplicity?’
Hon. Emperor inquire to know.</p>

<p>“‘No,’ say-he, ‘but Hon. Jefferson was.’</p>

<p>“‘Hon. Jefferson should try being an Ambassador
to Germany if he like it so well,’ say Hon. Emperor,
giving royal automobile one complete honk.”</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, question before Congress is this:
Can American Republick, at stingy expense, teach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
Kings, Princes, etc., to expect less spendthrifty
display whenever they goes to see American Ambassadors?
Maybe so it are possible. Maybe
Emperors, when they gets tired of ruling, will
become accustomed to saying, “Let’s go over to
Charley Tower’s flat and listen to Caruso on the
phonograph.” Maybe-so it will soon become a
common sight in Berlin to see the Hon. Emperor
buying 15c package of Frankfurters for luncheon
with Hon. American Ambassador. Maybe—but
Japanese Schoolboy are doubtful because he come
from a kingdom where habits of Emperors is often
observed. And I never seen no kings acting that
way.</p>

</div>

<p>Trouble with these U. S., Mr. Editor, is that they
is not so awful Progressive like they imagines they
are. It is a very nice thing to be noisy, but a shoot-cannon
must have something besides powder in
it to do considerable damage. America man work
pretty swift when let alone; but if he wait for act of
Congress he had more better wait for act of God
and the Russian Douma. There are just one body
of mans in the entire world slower than Hon.
Russian Douma, and that are Hon. American
Congress.</p>

<p>It take one of them degraded and outworn
monarchies of the Old World eighteen months to
stick together a first-class war-boat of very excellent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
trimmings. It take these swift U. S. six years to
nail together such a fighter-ship, and after them
six years is past American Congress awakes and
finds that it doesn’t need no navy nohow.</p>

<p>Hon. Congressman Captain Richard Peachy
Hobson arise recently for debate and do considerable
gun-fire with eyes.</p>

<p>“By all them sun-kissed hills of native land,”
he say with energy, “let us defend it. Japan are
a menace. So are China, Sweden, and the Malay
Archipelago. If all them dangerous nationalities
combined to do us dirt how would they go at it?
By fleets? In one week 17,000,000,000 yen would
flow into coffers of very yellow peril. In two weeks
78 extreme <i>Dreadnothings</i> would intend to go San
Francisco for warfare. In three weeks Japan
would be camping in Waldorf-Astoria and Sweden
would accept Milwaukee as spoil of war. Therefore
I arise up to propose it. I propose it that
Hon. Sharp Williams instruct the Democratic
minority to build 12 <i>Dreadnothing</i> battleships
weekly until election is over.”</p>

<p>(Loud groans from Jo-uncle Cannon.)</p>

<p>Uprise then Hon. Burton. “Mr. Speech,”
he-say it, “I uprise to second them bill of Hon.
Cap. Congressman Hobson; but with some slight
amendments to make it look natural. I propose
that them 12 <i>Dreadnothings</i> be reduced to 1 gunboat<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
to be built by Union Iron Works in 1926, in
case there ain’t no war before then.”</p>

<p>“But how to defend Hon. America without no
ships?” demand Hon. Hobson with voice.</p>

<p>“We are not afraid of all-world Powers,” declaim
Hon. Burton. “If Japan, England, Ireland, and
Spain come to our shores with latest pattern
explosives, then the indomitable spirit of American
people shall defend us!”</p>

<p>(Loud applause from Congress which continue
ahead with campaign program.)</p>

<p>Such is fate of Hon. Hobson’s hobby. It is
certain that Hon. Congress are not afraid of no
foreign navy. Hon. Congress is not afraid of
nothing when it do not cost them nothing to do so.</p>

<p class="tb">It are collapsible sentiment of all intelligent
Japanese, Mr. Editor, that Hon. Congress will
eventually, or later, build very magnificent
Embassies (on model of Pennsylvania State Capitol)
in Berlin, Paris, London, Tokyo, Pekin, and
wherever it is required by kings and fashionable
persons residing there. But before them buildings
is done some Bills must be made, revised, torn
up and referred to wastebasket in following committees:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—Committee on Architecture.</p>

<p>2—Committee on Plumbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>3—Committee on Window Curtains.</p>

<p>4—Committee on Foreign Relations.</p>

<p>5—Committee on Gas and Water.</p>

</div>

<p>By the time them bills is passed America will
no longer be sneezed at as a Young Nation. And
in the mean while Hon. Ambassadors from these
U.S. must be subsidized by some Trust or else ride
in trolley cars between Hon. Embassy and Hon.
German Court.</p>

<span class="smaller">A THIRD TERM FOR OUR EMPEROR</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, February 23rd.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To postoffice of New York Newspaper to be found
there by Editor.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>: I will not vote for President this
time, thank you, because your Emperor, Mr.
Roosevelt, will not run to get it. Therefore I
am neglectful about all other Candidates.</p>

<p>Little Annie Anazuma, eight-years-age, daughter
of I. Anazuma, Japanese barber, come to me
with childish inquisitive.</p>

<p>“Tell me one truth, Uncle Togo,” she deploy.
“Is it possible to think that Japanese Boy will
some day be President of this respectable
kingdom?”</p>

<p>“Hardy so—and yet maybe,” I addict with
deceptive expression.</p>

<p>“So happy to think!” negotiate this infant enthusiasm,
with fond smiling. “Then how must
he go to it to become such a President?”</p>

<p>“He must firstly obtain consent of Hon. Roosevelt,
who probably would not give it,” I dictate
because I am aware it might be so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Are it customary for Presidents to select with
voice name of some gentleman what would be less
disgusting to him for next King of America?” require
this Infant Prodigal, who are too ingrown
of brain for enjoy mere doll-play.</p>

<p>“Ah, sure yes!” I explode. “If gentleman
what have been in White House 4 years do not
know a good President when he see him, who
would?”</p>

<p>“When inexperienced gentleman are called by
White House to take job he must enjoy great
agony trying to study Constitution, boat-building,
Tuskagee, &amp; other racing problembs necessary
to encumbrance of office,” she say-it.</p>

<p>“That are still customary,” I report.</p>

<p>“Who commence to originate this merciful
custom?” demand little Annie.</p>

<p>“Because you are childish I make education
for you. Pres. Roosevelt done it.”</p>

<p>“So happy to know!” digest this Japanese child.
“He is great Emperor of America—therefore he
will last forever.”</p>

<p>“So sorry to reply,” I disgust. “Hon. Pres.
Roosevelt will soon stop doing it.”</p>

<p>“Tell me to know, Uncle Togo,” examine this
difficult infant. “Is not Emperors made to last
considerable length?”</p>

<p>“In responsible kingdoms, yes-so—but in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
America, no-so. Here Kings is elected for 4
years to discouridge them.”</p>

<p>“These white-coloured foreigners is too hard
answers for children to know,” say little Annie
Anazuma running away for play-doll amusement.</p>

<p>I say these lectures to Little Annie with great
pleasure to be telling something to somebody
what believes it. But then come brain-thoughts
which bring enjoyment of fierce pangs. What
to do with America when Emperor Roosevelt
has took himself from it? I enquire for answer.</p>

<p>I beg you to do it as request, Mr. Editor.
Please have your printer put some words on
editorial page asking Hon. Roosevelt to continue
once more term as Emperor of this Republic.
I enclose cash of 50c. to pay for your expense of
writing, etc. Thank you so many!</p>

<p class="tb">Honest to truth, I am aggregated with anger
to have Mr. Emperor Roosevelt dictate, “No
thank you, not for three-times running!” Why
so does he stop being King just at instant when
all-national people is enjoying that American
performance? It will be sad for my heart to see
some private person occupying public career of
Hon. Roosevelt when he gets through sitting on it.</p>

<p>What decry Julius Cæsar about being elected too
much for Republican party of Rome? “One good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
term deserves another,” he command, and Mr.
Brutus was pleased to be there with stabbing-knife.
But this is different subject from what about it.</p>

<p class="tb">Now it is historical knowledge that Pres.
Roosevelt is ignorant about fear. What does
frighten him, then, about this Third Term business
affair? Because Hon. Geo. Washington said
not do it? So ridicule for great man to think!
Hon. Roosevelt is not afraid of Hon. Washington.
Then go ahead, Mr. Roosevelt, please! Continue
terming for several more administrations.</p>

<p>Whenever I think of some private gentleman
being public President of U. S. I spill tear-drop
from sadness. Mere human person like Hon.
Taft is large enough to entirely fill throne with
himself but he can not fill it with that marvellous
activity of Roosevelt.</p>

<p class="tb">Hon. Jenny Bryan, so I read by news-prints,
has went out for duck-shoot and also hoping to
slew some bears. This show how sadly he long
for President. But nothing to do! Mr. Jenny is
too quiet Democrat for election. He must murder
something or make elopement with somebody’s
grandmother to get photo in newspaper any more.
Then American persons will remember he is
alive and nominate him for another defeat.</p>

<p>In what administration was Hon. Bryan President<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
of these Uniteds State? I ask these ignorant
question because Hon. Bryan happened before I
arrived here.</p>

<p>Time is passed, Mr. Editor, for American gentleman
to be President by merely being so. Prince
Albert cutaway and sky-scrape eye-brow with
patriotic noise from stump are decomposed from
modern politics, thank you. Successful candidate
for America must not only stand on stump for
speech—he must use stump for downside-up gymnasticks
employing heels for passionate gestures.
If candidate can not do nothing else he must be
owner of Trust or some other respectable business.</p>

<p>Whenever I have look-at some American gentleman
behaviour strange and queer in publick,
then I enjoy suspicion, “That person is expecting
for nomination to President!”</p>

<p>Because this. When gentleman require to be
notice by Delegates of Convention he must perform
something queer in publicity. Sometime
he take too much cocktail, sometime too much
buttermilk—drink depending on religious training.
Then all newspapers go to his doorway and
ask for photo, childhood and name of party by
which he prefers to be runned. Pretty soonly this
candidate is celebrated name in all mouths. After
this he may be elected, which is too difficult to
think about, thank you!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>By last week I seen Yoni Sadekachi, wealthy
and influential Japanese greenhouse, enjoying
phenomenal cataclyptic spasm of fits on street
corner. Large crowd was present including
three American reporters. Next morning following
headline in all American newspaper:</p>

<p class="center">JAPANESE SPASM OF FITS!!!</p>

<p class="center">HON. YONI SADEKACHI ENJOYS ONE AND<br>
GAINS LARGE MERIT OF JAPANESE<br>
VOTERS PRESENT.<br>
WILL HE BE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT?<br>
WE ASK TO KNOW</p>

<p>Pretty soonly news-children scream announcement
all over this America. Political man see
this and report. “Yes, please, this Hon. Yoni will
make very happy candidate for Republican party
with fusion of Japanese Socialists. It will be
pleasant to mention him if everything else fails.”</p>

<p>This is to show, Mr. Editor, how dangerous
it is to encourage talented Japanese in this
kingdom.</p>

<p>One Japanese poem, please, for your printer
to practise on:</p>

who took decease by asthma in joints. So she
approached to me yesterday with customary tear-drop
&amp; 1 pair pants to say:</p>

<p>“These property of past Macdonald I am give
to you because they wake bitter memories &amp; are
wore out around knees.” Slight sobs from her.</p>

<p>I observe them hon. pants which is very tall
garments of dissipated appearance.</p>

<p>“O thank you so many, Hon. Mrs. Madam!”
I report with salvo. “I shall took them home
&amp; rehearse wearing them.” I back off for respect
and get away with them hon. pants.</p>

<p>At Patriots of Japan Boarding &amp; Lodging, where
I hope to move from before payment is necessary,
I lock myself away with them garment, and try
to make it fit. So sorry can’t do! When I clasp
it with dignified safety-pin at waist each leg is too
far beyond my foots—it give me reverent appearance
of kneeling. I try to deceive them pants to
look briefer by rolling them upwards. Also I
coax them at stummick by fastening belt around
shoulders. By this way I am entirely inside of
that tailorship which is too plenty.</p>

</div>

<p>Then suddenly Cousin Nogi make in-come to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
room, because he is a relative and can do so without
knocking. He look quite gast at me.</p>

<p>“You are clothed entirely,” he signify with
smart expression.</p>

<p>“Would they fit me perhaps?” I ask for vanity.</p>

<p>“Maybe so they might,” dictate Nogi, “but
they are too loose around neck.”</p>

<p>“What to do with such gifts from lady?” I
inquire for reply.</p>

<p>“To wear it next to heart,” contuse Nogi with
smiling. “If you wear it on publick streetfare
crowd will collect to indicate that you are one very
famous Japanese. Persons will proclaim: ‘There
go them Hon. Pants!’ Maybe you will be escort
by police wherever went. It is so easy to become
famous.”</p>

<p>“No can do, please!” I prefer.</p>

<p>“No to?” stagger Nogi for disappoint.</p>

<p>“Ah, no!” I relapse. “I should not desire to
become famous for pants. Hon. Modesty is a
Japanese characteristick.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Modesty is a disease,” corrode that Nogi
with scornful snip; so he tell following myth of
antique Japan which is a very favourite stories of
Grandmothers to illustrate the Hon. Modesty.</p>

<p class="tb">In some way-back period of <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> there reside at
Kioto one Emperor by name of Motomatsu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
who was awful modest about it. When spoke of
as Famous he became a very ill person. He was
shy about publick banzai. When he depart out
from Hon. Palace for auto-ride all loyal subjecks
was lined up by pave to decry: “Banzai! Banzai!
Such nice Emperor Motomatsu!” They
then kneel upon their faces to signify it. But
Hon. Motomatsu enjoy angry rage for such publick
demonstrictions and decry: “So conspickerous!”
while he kick loyal subjecks on skull. Because
he was shy.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly he make sneek out of Palace by
back door to avoid them noyful mob of shoutings.
But one Grocery Boy seen him and observe to
inquire: “Why do Kings go out by back doors
when should not?” “Hush it!” say Motomatsu.
“I am doing it so as not to be too famous.” So
when he make pass-on them Grocery Boy go to all
populus of Japan and decry: “Hon. Emperor is
departing by back door!” Then 1,000,000 of
them loyal subjecks assemblance to trademan
entrance of Palace &amp; peek to see—and sure of!
Hon. Emperor again is saw making sneek-in to
Palace. “Permit us to hail!” say peasantry, but
Hon. Emperor relapse with peev: “Go hail somewheres
else!” And he throw brick-bat to them.</p>

<p>So them Hon. Emperor get worse modest all
time. Pretty soonly he borrow rag-clothing from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
beggerly man and wander forth in them disguise.
But Hon. Populus, when they seen him, decry:
“O look-see what has arrive! Our dear Emperor
are ragged out to be a beggerly man! Is he not
conspickerous in such a clothing? Ah, yes!”
And they surround him with a program of dances,
including exhibitions of jiu jitsu, resolutions of
respeck, geisha waltz, speek, fireworks &amp; baloon-races.
Pretty soonly Carnegie Commission
approach with brass medal of reward. “For
what?” say Hon. Emperor. “For extreme shyness
in action,” say Hon. Commission. By this
Hon. Motomatsu is very disgust, so he cut off
them Commission at neck, then he chop 1,000
loyal subjecks with ax and go back Palace.</p>

<p>But when them loyal subjecks pick up their
heads what was chopped they say: “Sure is!
Mr. Emperor must be modest about publick
appearance. Quite well! Then we will cease
hailing him, if he is so disagree.”</p>

<p>Next day when Hon. Emperor go off for walk,
what! Such vacancy of street! He is queer to
feel. He go back Palace with lonesome smile.
“Maybe I am dress too silently to be seen,” he-say.
So he put on uniform of Field Marshall &amp; walk
outside again. Nothing to do. Even little sparrow-birds
is absent with banzais. “O mania!
Have I quit being famous?” subtract that Motomatsu,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
losing some flesh for griefs. So by soon-time
he make début to street in drum-major
uniform recruited by very large brass band. But
Hon. Publick is home reminding their own business.
This are too much worry for Hon. Emperor
who go bed &amp; is attended by appendicitis. Pretty
soonly he enjoy death and got a tomb near Kioto.
In front of it are following inscription:</p>

<p class="center">“Motomatsu have got his bones here.<br>
He were a Good Advertiser;<br>
But he Worked it too Hard.”</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, Hon. Modesty were a disease very
common among Great Mens in antique Japan.
In these here day modern insanitary methods of
brushing off microbes have got rid of such shy
germs pretty good. Yet Great Mens is still in
some tiny danger of being bit by it. At White
Palace of Washington Dr. Rickey must be in constant
attendance with microscope to watch for it.
Each President Message must be very careful
fumigated—and on some days this are pretty
much of a job, thank you.</p>

<p>By each morning-time Hon. President must
have corner of eye-glasses, mustache &amp; tooths
examined for fearful that some Wyoming constituent
might maybe brought in bashful germs that
will get into Hon. Policies &amp; spoil everything.</p>

<p>This Surgeon-Gen. Rickey must be a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
worried person. Suppose he go cod-fishing some
Sunday off &amp; become carelus about them hon.
microbes? Ah, fatal! Next morning he go to
White Cabinet &amp; discover Hon. President enjoying
high temperature of terrible blushes.</p>

<p>“Sec. Loeb,” he are saying, “please turn to
Nineteenth Interstate Proclamation, page 1102B,
and attack it with blue pencil.”</p>

<p>“Quite good, Mr. Sire,” say them Hon. Loeb.
“What to do with them words?”</p>

<p>“Scratch out all pronouns spelled with an ‘I’
and supply ‘American People’ for it,” say Hon.
President.</p>

<p>“Will do,” say Hon. Sec. with nervous glance.</p>

<p>“Next substitute considerable changes. Change
‘My Policies’ to ‘Mr. Bryan’s Policies,’ change
‘My Navy’ to ‘Admiral Brownson’s Navy,’
change——”</p>

<p>Dr. Rickey stand at corner of room with horrors
springing at knees. “It are my carelus fault—some
scarce disease have got in through window!”
he whisper to guilty self.</p>

<p>“Next turn attention to library of books,” say
that Presidential Invalid. “Change ‘My Works’
to ‘Works of Divine Providence.’ Every time
‘Grizzly Bear’ are mention change it to ‘Grey
Squirrel,’ change ‘Must Not’ to ‘Please Don’t,’
change——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“Stop it, Mr. Sire!” say them Physician with
alarms; “if you continue it thus you will have
‘Malefactors’ changed to ‘Benefactors’!”</p>

<p>So White House Hospital Corps are ringed for
and Hon. President took by forceful quarantine to
Federal Hospital where one porous plaster are
put on his Ego to draw it out. While enjoying
relapse there he occupy cot formerly layed in by
Hons. Albert Beverage, Ben Tillman &amp; other Egos
enjoying the same shy germ.</p>

<p class="tb">What would become of Hon. Literature, Mr.
Editor, if them Literaries was nibbled by Hon.
Modesty? What would become of Publishing
Business if Hon. Mrs. Eleanor McGlynty, after
wroting one book of title, “Three Months,”
should spend that period of time blushing over
what ensue in it? What would happen to Hon.
Jack of London or Hon. Thomas of Boston if they
forgot to tell Hon. World how remarkably much
they are? Would Hon. World remember their
praises if <i>they</i> didn’t? I ask to know.</p>

<p>What would ensue if Hon. Bernard Shaw should
took the habit of shrinkage? Might he know how
to stop before he had entirely shrunk away until
he was very little more than size of Homer, Shakespeare
&amp; any other insignificate super-gentleman?
I require no answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Editor, if I had died in old-fashion generation
of water-power reputation I would have
got on my tombstone:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 15em;">

<span class="smaller">SPRING</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, April 1st.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor of New York newspaper which rains
supreme for intelligence of editorial tipewriting.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span> O! Spring have came!</p>

<p>Where did it arrive from? is question for Japanese
Boy.</p>

<p>Do it arrive from Palm Beach of sunny climb,
song-sing of nightinglory-bird, hypnotism of
tropick mooners where poets is whacking musical
liars in the middle of such nice weather? Do it
arrive from ore the sea blew along by Rory Bory
Alice &amp; other mythology ladies of awfully gauze
dressing which travel by zephyr to drop don’t-forget-me
bud &amp; other garden seeds on top of happy
farmer? Ah no! it do not.</p>

<p>Where <i>do</i> this Spring arrive from then, if not?</p>

<p>By newspaper print I read how it arrive from
Paris, thank you!</p>

<p>Flower of Spring do not come to America by
them poetical way I said. They are first noticed
in New York by Hon. Custom Inspector who give
American eye-wink when he see such many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
trunks of French extraction. He notice they are
label “Handle by Care,” so he open them carefully
with an axe. From each divided trunk come
explosion of rare beaty. Violet-colour roses,
rose-colour violets, blue-colour carnations, off-colour
daisies, lilies-of-valley in red, white, &amp;
blue and sunflowers of 27 delicious varieties of
sunset. That sad interior of Custom House, so
oftenly accustomed to shady gloom of dark &amp;
dingley Tariff, grow suddenly to joyful fire-alarm
by them race-riot of colour. All employees of
them Custom House forget murdering thought of
their cruel hearts and is instantly gentle by sight of
such bouquets. They forget to do their duty on
sliding scale. Their eyes is overdone for tear
drop with sweetheart thought of childhood.
Numberous sighs is enjoyed while looking to them
flowers, all hats is removed and for one noment of
time that Custom House forget to think of Eternal
Revenue on cigars, the patness of Jo-uncle Cannon
and welcome to America by the Uncivil Service.
Such is influence of Nature on savage persons.</p>

<p>Then come Easter and I am not responsible for
what happen. Hon. Solomon, who was legally
accustomed to 100 wifes, was very suspicious about
Spring when it come along from Paris, so he say
with voice for all future layers of Husbands, “Consider
the lilies how they cost!” When one Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
lady begin to consider the lilies in shop window
it is important for Christian Husband to consider
something else with absent-minded expression.</p>

<p class="tb">In Spring young American mind naturally turn
to sport of baseballing. Japanese Boy have found
out how-do to get there to place where them
National Sport is done. Walk some distance to
suburbs of trolley when, all of a suddenly, you
will notice a sound. It is a very congregational
lynch-law sound of numberous voices doing it all
at once. Silence punctuates this. Then more of.</p>

<p>“Why all this yall about, unless of mania?”
I require to know from Hon. Police.</p>

<p>“San Francisco is in it and Oakland is outside of
it,” say Hon. Police with moustache. “San
Francisco have made bat-hit and three gentlemans
have arrive home.”</p>

<p>“So happy to welcome travellers!” I decry.
“Have them gentlemans been long absent for such
publick banzai?”</p>

<p>“All over bean-farm,” say Hon. Police. “They
was all on bags,” he say, “and two mans had died
on first basso——”</p>

<p>“I shall enjoy mourning for them heroes,” I
retort.</p>

<p>“—then Hon. Murphy acquire one base by
high finance.”</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus08" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus08.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">“‘Why all this yall about, unless of mania?’ I require
to know from Hon. Police”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“How-so he possess this base?” is next question
for me.</p>

<p>“He steal it,” say Hon. Police with cigar.</p>

<p>I admire talents of that Hon. Murphy who can
steal things while all publick make shout of
applaud. With practice he would become very
delicious Senator.</p>

<p>More loud yall of shouts is heard. I am an
enthusiasm. What fierce harakiri of patriotism
was going on to make them Americans so loud?
Such sound of hates! Port Arthur was took with
less noise than that. Therefore I must see about it.</p>

<p>I go to fence where ticket-hole demand 50c of
price to see it.</p>

<p>“Why must Japanese Boy pay such price?”
I renig.</p>

<p>“Because-so,” say Ticketer, “Baseballing is
National Sport. Therefore each patriot must pay
them 50c for Campaign Fund to Hon. Cortelyou.”</p>

<p>I admit myself to gate.</p>

<p>In seats around gallery all-American persons is
settled in state of very hoarse condition. Downstairs
on ground is 10 to 11 Baseballers engaged in
doing so. I am scientifick about this Game which
is finished by following rules:</p>

<p>One strong-arm gentleman called a Pitch is
hired to throw. Another gentleman called a
Stop is responsible for whatever that Hon. Pitch<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
throw to him, so he protect himself from wounding
by sofa-pillows which he wear on hands.
Another gentleman called a Striker stand in front
to that Stop and hold up club to fright off that
Hon. Pitch from angry rage of throwing things.
But it is useless. Hon. Pitch in hand hold one
baseball of an unripe condition of hardness.
He raise that arm lofty—then twist—O sudden!
He shoot them bullet-ball straight to breast of Hon. Stop.
Hon. Striker swing club for vain effort.
It is a miss &amp; them deathly ball shoot Hon. Stop in
gloves. “Struck once!” decry Hon. Umperor,
a person which is there to gossip about it in loud
voice.</p>

<p>“Why do Hon. Umperor demand Hon. Striker
to struck when he have already did so?” I
demand to know from one large German intelligence
what set next by me.</p>

<p>“He is fanning himself outside,” make that
courteous foreigner for reply, so I prefer to
understand.</p>

<p>Once more-time that Hon. Pitch prepare to
enjoy some deathly agony. He hold that ball
outside of twisted forearm, turn ½ beside himself,
throw elbows away, give whirling salute of head,
caress ankle with calf of leg, then up-air—quickly
shoot! Ball journey to Hon. Stop with whizz,
but before arriving there Hon. Striker see it with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
club. There is considerable knock-sound as
club collide to ball which stops continuing in that
direction and bounds uply to air. Great excitement
for all America! All spectacles in grand-stand
decry, “O make sliding, Hon. Sir!” and
many voices is seriously spoiled as Hon. Striker
run with rapid heels from each base to next &amp;
all other Baseballers present endeavour to pull
down that ball which is still in very high sky.
But soonly that ball return down and is bounded
into hands of second basso sportsman who shoot
it to Hon. Stop just as Hon. Striker is sliding
to fourth base by the seat of his stummick.</p>

<p>“Out!” decry Hon. Umperor, so Hon. Striker
go set himself on back bench, which is deserving
place for all heroes.</p>

<p>So many Strikers is brought up to do them
clubbing acts during game that it become a
monotony to Japanese Boy in a very soon time.
But not-so it was to Americans who was fuller
of Indiana yalls. Occasionally that large
German intelligence what set next to me would
say with voice, “Kill that Umperor!”</p>

<p>“Why should Hon. Umperor be executed?”
I require for answer.</p>

<p>“I am not sure why-is,” extort that German.
“But it is courteous to demand his death
occasionally.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“Is this Umperor such a sinful citizen?” I
make note; but that Hon. German did not
response because he was drownding his voice
from one bottle of pop-soda for value of 5c.</p>

<p>I wait for very large hour to see death of this
Hon. Umperor, but it did not occur as I seen.
Too bad! I had very good seat to see from.</p>

<p>Baseballing is healthy game for Americans.
It permits them to enjoy sunstroke in middle of
patriotick sounds, it teach them a entirely
courageous vocabulary and put 10,000,000,000,000
peanuts in circulation by each annual year. Japan
must learn to do it. If all Japanese wishing to
become heroes should go set in bleachers each
afternoon-time it might change them from Yellow
Peril to yelling section in short generation.</p>

<p>But warfare is a more agreeable way.</p>

<p>Spring was discovered by Japanese several
years before zero. Antique Japanese noblemans,
when they seen sweet Irish-flowers blooming and
acting fresh was suspicious that maybe it was
sign of Spring, but they did not say-so nothing
about it, because laws was very just in them date.
Hon. Bashu, celebrated for Japanese poetry, say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Hon. Japanese Emperor read this songsing
and call Hon. Bashu to court-house and give him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
one chop-off by axe. “You are too original for
to live,” he say by remark.</p>

me. Literary writing must be good job for all
Americans not fit for honest work. I am understood
to be told that Hon. Jack London receive
for price from 15c to 20c for each word he make.
This is so very easy way it appear deceptive.
How should I prosper in such a Graft! At 20c
for each word how happy for Japanese Boy!
By early morning I should go to fashionable
American restaurant and require of Waiter,
“Hon. Sir., deliver to me 1 plate ham &amp; 2 eggs,
please!” This would be the number of 12 words
@ 20c per word—therefore bringing me the
price $2.40! Breakfast might cost 75c, Waiter
might require 25c to tip himself, yet Waiter must
still owe Japanese Boy $1.40, which is balance of
$2.40 for them 12 words I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>Immediately I became great Author in my brain-thoughts.
I make running stampede to publick
Library and read “12th Night,” by Shakespeare of
England and “Friday the 13th” by Lawson of
Boston, so as to learn both ends of the American
language. I learn considerable extinct vocabulary
from both of these gentlemen, then I set down with
ink-stand to write 1 letter to you.</p>

<p>It is not equal to human justice, Mr. Editor,
that you send me $4.34 in postage stamps as reply
payment to this. What to do with these stamps?
217 2c postages require considerable correspondence
to get away from. To waste these postages
I have wrote following correspondence:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. To New York Newspaper already 10 letters
which you know of.</p>

<p>2. To Uncle Hashimura of Kobe, 6 letters of
painful truth.</p>

<p>3. To Miss Alice Furioki, pleasant lady of
yellow extraction, 13 letters on sweetheart subjects.</p>

<p>4. To Pres. Roosevelt, King Edward, F.
Augustus Heintz &amp; Eugene Schmitz 48 total
letters.</p>

</div>

<p>These make all together 77 stamps used up.
Therefore I have got remaining in my pocket 140
stamps, many of which is ruined by wear. In
next payment for my literary letters would you
be so regardless as to make reply in nickel-pieces?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
These moneys is small, but very good for Japanese
education. Thanks so many!</p>

<p>If I could get good job somewhere writing
novel-books I would learn this American language,
which is hard thing to do because so full of words.
American gentlemen I have speaked to employ
the 2 following kinds of conversation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Kind what is discovered in Dixionary book.</p>

<p>2. Kind what is not there.</p>

</div>

<p>In Dixionary of Hon. Noah Webster there contain
26,000 language-words to talk. It took this
gentleman lifetime to do so. To speak American
language it is necessary to learn them 26,000
natural words, which I have did, thank you. But
it is useless to try so hard because Elsewhere-words
is commonly used for conversation. Where
must Japanese Boy go to obtain such talk?</p>

<p>My cousin Nogi explain this answer. He
say that Elsewhere-words of American mans
is called “Slank,” which means “talking-with-words-that-is-found-here-and-there.”
Dixionary talk is good for church sociables, high-schools, and
professors; Slank talk is good for riots, prize-fighting,
newspapers, colleges, and all kinds of
energy. Both are good ways to know.</p>

<p>Frequently in walking about sidewalk I hear
gentlemans cry, “24 for you!” This is signal
for great laugh which all do. I can not tell when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
to, so I do not. What then is so humoristic
about this number “24”? Would not number
12 or number 14 do equally fine for laughing
purposes? I require to know.</p>

<p>Lemons, too, is comic fruit for Slank-talking
persons. Joking-gentlemans deliver these lemon
fruit to each other for holiday gift. It is insulting
not to laugh when this is done.</p>

<p>To-day I speak to Hon. Mr. Strunsky, Irish
gentleman, about Hon. W. J. Bryan, late President
of these Uniteds State.</p>

<p>“Where has he fell to?” I require for answer.</p>

<p>“This Bryan man is dead one,” report Hon.
Strunsky.</p>

<p>“So sorry—I shall wear mourning for this
good man,” I reject.</p>

<p>“Tall timber is place for you,” resume this
Strunsky man with laughing eye.</p>

<p>“So sorry not to do,” I say back, “because
forest is far distant from great city.”</p>

<p>“Then pursue self around this block, Hon.
Togo,” he compel. I do so, thank you. But
while exercising I stop with abrupt brain-thought.
Them words of Mr. Strunsky was less Dixionary
talk than Slank talk! Tell me, Mr. Editor, how
should I translate them conversation of Strunsky
into Japanese?</p>

<p>It is disadvantage of American language that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
gentlemen cannot be insulting to each other
without some impoliteness. One gentleman meet
some other gentleman at saloon-corner. Making
step-up to each other one gentleman explain,</p>

<p>“You are a pill!”</p>

<p>Immediately following noises are enjoyed:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Night cry.</p>

<p>2. Broken property.</p>

<p>3. Approach of ambulance.</p>

<p>4. Silence.</p>

</div>

<p>In Japan, among top-classes, trouble is enjoyed
more peaceably. Suppose Count Noku desire
to have insult with Baron Obi. They shall meet
at lunch, thank you, to talk this. They first
disgust their appetites with tea, cigarettes, Japanese
ginger-snaps, conversation. Finally at last
Count Noku say to Baron Obi,</p>

<p>“Esteemed &amp; high-horse Samurai, would you
care to have insult for me?”</p>

<p>“Magnificent Count,” say this Obi, “it is your
exalted privilege to insult me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for the benefit,” say this Noku, “I
will do so.” And so saying this he pull one hair
from head of that Obi.</p>

<p>“Ouch, thank you, I am insult!” retort Baron
Obi. Following this there is quiet hara-kiri with
table-knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>At food-stand of Mr. Swartz I often lunch there
for economy. Best nourishment may be obtained
for 5c by ordering 3 sausages from Frankfurter
Germany with slice of toast.</p>

<p>Yesterday I go as customary to this. As
customary I say, “Give me the same, those 3
sausages from Frankfurter.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Swartz, turning to cookeryman, cry
with voice:</p>

<p>“Hot-dog!”</p>

<p>Therefore I must not eat them food because it
is cannibalism. If Mr. Swartz is not speaking
Slank talk, then he should be sent to prison for
Pure Food Laws.</p>

<p>You may see, Mr. Sir., how it is not safe to go
around in this U. S. without sufficient Slank
words. Japanese schoolboys might be poisoned
by eating something which is Slank for something
else. To example this danger, my cousin Nogi
say how Hon. Casey of Labouring Union is “a
lobster.” I am very fond to eat lobster, but I
should disgust to eat this Mr. Casey.</p>

<p>I have been collecting them Elsewhere-words
all day and have congregated quite a cluster of
Slank talk which I shall put into Dixionary for
Japanese Schoolboys. I am very excited when
I think of this vocabulary. I have arranged
many of them raggle-time speeches into following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
poetical thought which I was misfortune enough
to sent with 2c postage to Miss Alice Furioki,
lady I tell you I was engaged to marry with:</p>

<p>I would of send this by wire-telegraf, but Hon.
Operator was inattentive about me when I have
no price sufficiently much to. He say: “Who-pay?”
I-say: “Hon. Editor.” “Hon. Editor
may-be-so will,” he demure and resume job of
tick-tick. Good-by for me.</p>

<p>Morning of fleet-arrive was splandid. By
early hour of day all S. F. persons has clustered
therselves on tip of hills &amp; suppression of
excitement was enjoyed. Considerable watching
occurred. Barking of dogs was strangled by collars,
infant babies which desired to weep was spanked
for prevention of. Silences. Depressed banners
was held in American hands to get ready wave it.</p>

<p>Many persons in Sabbath clothings was there,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
including 1,000 Japanese Spies which were very
nice behaviour. I was nationally proud of them.</p>

<p>Of suddenly, Oh!!!</p>

<p>Through crack of Goldy Gate, what-see?
Maglifisent sight of marine insurance! Floating
war-boats of dozens approaching directly straight
by line &amp; shooting salutes at people. On come
them Imperial Navy of Hon. Roosevelt &amp; Hon.
Hobson; what heart could quit beating at it?
Such white paint—like bath-tub enamel, only
more respectful in appearance.</p>

<p>All shout, all maddy banzai, including me &amp;
Cousin Nogi which was wishing that Hon. Togo
could been there to shoot in opposite direction.
Would it not been a impressive pair of naval
spectacles? I ask to know.</p>

<p>From collected ½ million of persons on hills of
S. F. one mad yall of star-spangly joy. Fire-crack
salute, siren whistle, honk-horn, megaphone,
extra edition, tenor solo—all connected together
to give impressions of loyal panderonium. What
say Lord Macawber, English history-poet, in
“Lies of Ancient Rome”?</p>

<p>I haven’t yet saw them gallant Adm. Robert D.
Evans, but I take delicious look at Hon. Battle-boat
<i>Conn.</i> by 2 opera glasses (kindness loan of
Cousin Nogi) &amp; there I see one commanding figure
stooding on ¼ deck where shoot &amp; shell might go
muckraking four &amp; aft, if such a rude target-practice
was going on. Was man I seen them
famous sea-doggy what have drove that fleet from
N.Y. to S.F. while enjoying twitches of pain what
would make considerable Heroes want to quit?
If that man I seen was Hon. Evans, Japanese
Samurai wants to remove cap to him. He are not
a Hero—he are a Marter, which is a Hero tied
to a post.</p>

<p>(When Hon. Operator seen my telegraf he-say:
“What language is them wrote in?” I am
confused.)</p>

<p>For space of several next days this Hon. City
are overcame by considerable Program. Something
go on each elsewhere including new-build
section &amp; also places where remainders of Hon.
Earthquack are still enjoyed. Following was did
from what little I was aware:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Wed.</i>—Toot-whistle, anchor-fleet, boom-salute—hurrah!
Hon. Mr. Mayor Taylor &amp;
High Governor Gilette go-see Flagship <i>Conn.</i>
“How-do, Adm. Evans!” Fleet shake-hands<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
with yackts, tug-boats, ferry-boats &amp; all official
vehicles. Hon. Evans come shore. Salutes.
Honk-auto to Hotel Fairmont where Adm. Evans
meet Mrs. Evans. More salutes. All Hon.
Officers come march-in with un-officered excitement.
Quiet bouquets. By evening Hon. Sec.
Metcalf enjoy grand waltz-time Hotel Fairmont.
I am not familiar with when this was expected to
burst up.</p>

<p><i>Thur.</i>—Awful important parade along line
of march including National Guard and other
private carriages. American standing army was
included in this together with such Generals as
was there. All blue-jackets, marines &amp; officers
march in this; but Hon. Battleboats did not
come ashore, because they could not do. Market
Street all bunted with red, white &amp; blue &amp; 4th
of July enjoyed by all. Fatigue of march was
added to by speeches. By evening some more
waltz-time for Hon. Officers. Hon. Sailors must
not be careless about steam-beer. All burst up
by early clock.</p>

<p><i>Fri.</i>—All go visit Hon. America Fleet. Great
relays of persons in boat-loads because everybody
was anxious. Visitors including of College Presidents,
Labouring Unions, Society, Persons &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
many more. Special reception was gave to 1,000
Japanese Spies which came with kodaks.</p>

<p><i>Sat.</i>—This day has not arrived yet; but we
expect it.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Editor, I am anxious to where them Hon.
Fleet will next go by departure. Will Japan be
visited firstly &amp; then some Christian country,
or will it be <i>visa-vis</i>? I ask to know, because way
them Fleet act are highly probable to Japanese
Schoolboy.</p>

<p>Will you please wrote letter to Hon. Metcalf
inflaming him about not having them Hon. Fleet
go visit China? After U. S. Navy have saw Japan
she will not care go China, I say it because. Japan
are a deliciously arranged country with hot &amp;
cold water in all rivers and streams. Japan are
picturesque with addition of all modern improvement.
America tourist can go top of anteek temple
Nara, by all-night elevator service. 2c tip for
this. Geisha-girl do quaint dance to Edison
phonograph musick. Jinrikisha run by gasolene
motor make very speed time. Japan are a very
antiseptick island full of Art. America fleeters
will enjoy this &amp; buy souvenirs for minus price.
Pleasant farewell, Hon. America, &amp; no fights with
Togo.</p>

Why should civilized kingdom wish to retain open

China are awake, but she have missed her train.</p>

<p>Please don’t listen to Mr. Wu, Hon. Sir! Listen

famous airnots, has solved problemb of air
navigation again by very delicious wreckage.
Them Right Bros fly-tests is always shot off with
entire secrecy, so that Japanese navy won’t be
there to represent itself. This time them sky-boat
manoever were witnessed by less than 2,000
persons, mostly reporters, inventors &amp; foreign
powers, who seen very nicely from bushes 25
miles away where they was hid out of range of
Hon. Right’s shoot-gun.</p>

<p>New airship of Right Bros is called Mud Hen
II., because them crafts should all be named after
some bird what they act like. Hon. Bell’s air-boat
are called “White Wings” because they
never grow weary of trying to. That Mud Hen
II. are a 6-cylinder, runabout type of airoplane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
built on model of 3 pancakes and worked with
strings which Hon. Right have attached to
thumbs &amp; toes. To start them ship Hon. Right
lays himself on stummick and runs the engine
with his teeth. When he wish to go up he raise
elbows &amp; depresses toes. When he wish to
come down he stand on his head.</p>

<p>On this trip Right Bros start navigating from
Killed Devil Hill, which is in Southern states.

found comfortably setting on his airship in middle
of Elkins swamp. Except for 2 wings fraxured,
engine twisted off, propeller gone &amp; framework
on fire, them machinery landed without a mishap.
Hon. Right were congratulating himself by
shaking his broken hand.</p>

<p>Hon. Reporter from McClunsey’s Magazine
came up to say: “I represent it.”</p>

<p>Silence from Hon. Right.</p>

<p>“What natural views do you possess of mind
about future development of airoplanes for carrying
persons for traffick?” require Hon. Muckrake.</p>

<p>“I refuse to answer,” response Hon. Right
with E. H. Harriman signals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“Oh so hurrah!” collapse them Hon. Reporter.
“I got scoop news for McClunsey’s Magazine.
<span class="smcap">Hon. Right have spoke for first time!!</span>”</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, I am morely assured that aireal
navigation will be very cheap sport for poor mans.
Hickory wood are cheap, canvas are cheap, nails
are cheap &amp; life are cheap. All them is
necessary for one good airship. You can borrow
1 gas-engine from another automobile. Next
choose some bird what look safe &amp; intelligent &amp;
built your fly-machine to resemble it. If you
admire for pidgeons, then built one pidgeon-toe
air-plane. If you think hawks is most pleasant
fliers, all well; then make a hawkish air-boat.
Nail all them airship together with considerable
canvas &amp; light hickory corners, fasten on them
gas-engine what you have borrowed, carry such
machinery to vacant plains &amp; teach it to fly like
the bird what you admire most much.</p>

<p>All airships can fly, but some of them is very
hard to teach.</p>

<p>Last yesterday I was tooking a feet-walk by
lonesome hill of Berkeley. Among daisy-cup
grassy of steep slope I seen some machinery in
attitude of mechanical expectation. It were a
very cross-looking machinery like a bisickel
whose mother was a sail-boat. Several Hon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Professors was standing around to encourage
Hon. Airnot with statistick about dying for
science. Hon. Airnot speak of relatives in Kansas
City and regret sinful youth with considerable
paleness.</p>

<p>“What you so trembly for?” eject Professor
with Ben Tillman expression. “Are it possibly
that you are afraid to go up?”</p>

<p>“O earnestly no!” collapse them Airnot,
“I are entirely fearless about going up but it are
thoughts of going down what give me them quaker
feeling at elbow.”</p>

<p>More excitable preparation then. One Professor
arrive with tex-book entitle, “How Do It
to Fly”; yet some other bring telescope for see
him long off. One medical Doctor was also
present with muck-rakes, etc., so as to scrape
them Airnot off trees in case of. Nervous tense
enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>So Hon. Airnot say farewell speek to persons
present, including Hon. Wife who was in Chicago.
He also mention several technical terms with
considerable emotion &amp; all Scientists present
weep with eyes. Next he place self carefully to
seat with assistants of one Irish man what was
there merely to labour. Silence for pulses.</p>

<p>“Are you ready?” inquire Hon. Professor
with voice.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“Are!” response them birdy hero.</p>

<p>“Then go it!” suggest Hon. Professor. Awful
breathlessness. Hon. Airnot with brave grasp
of wrist throw handle-crank to start engine.
Nothing happen. Surprise from all. Hon.
Airnot then speak automobile language &amp; pull
more crank-wheel with thumbs. Complete
indifference from them engine.</p>

<p>“Chaloric energy are hypnotized,” say one
Scientist who supposed he knew.</p>

<p>“You have forgot-it to put in gasolene,”
corrode Irish man what was there to labour.</p>

<p>“So have!” say Airnot. So Hon. Gasolene
was poured to engines with can.</p>

<p>Once more prepare to start. Hon. Airnot
take seat. Quick jerk to crank-handle. O
banzai! Whirr of angry rages from engine.
Entire fly-machine get palpitation to resemble
rooster severed from its brains. Irish man give
shove, &amp; complete bird-boat motor along ground on
bisickel wheels. More fast &amp; more faster it
go, kicking up pebbles in frantick enjoyment,
some time rising to astonishy hight of ¼ inch,
now &amp; yet bumptious to large stone and appearing
anxious to fly, but not sure how; till of suddenly
it make very restful flop against fence-post
&amp; stop desiring to continue.</p>

<p>Loud shouting from all Airo Clubs present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>“I ask to know,” I require, “for why does all
make such pagan noise of gladness?”</p>

<p>“For following reason,” decrop one Professor,
“because aireal navigation are solved.”</p>

<p>“All airships is modeled to resemble some
kind of birds,” I say for interview. “Some to
resemble sparrows, some to resemble hawk—what
species of birdy are this fly-boat modeled
to resemble?”</p>

<p>“It are modeled to resemble a ostrich,” say
Hon. Airnot, picking up some fingers he lost.</p>

<p>“But a ostrich are not able to fly,” I snuggest.</p>

<p>“Neither are this airship,” say Hon. Airnot in
whispering voice so as U. S. Govt might not
overheard.</p>

<p>So all sujurn to Airo Club banquet with exception
of Hashimura Togo &amp; Hon. Irish which
was not invited. We set together on grassy hill
for slight conversation about human progress.</p>

<p>“Of surely, Mike,” say Irish with smoke-pipe
of dangerous shortness, “airshipping are a
grand sporty.”</p>

<p>“It are still a low-down science,” I mangle.</p>

<p>“Why a package of fools should do it, I am
willing to be searched,” he dib. “They spend
1,000’s of dollar to make such a mechanical
rooster what we seen this afternoon. They work
for 2 year to nail it together, they hire famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Airnot from Kansas City, they get names in paper
&amp; all Science must stop thinking about serious
things because they are so excited. Then great
day arrive. All ready—<i>whoof!</i> $6,000 air-boat
make flopping emotion and go bust by fence-post.
Everybody happy to go home &amp; construpt more
airboats.”</p>

<p>“Great things of World are built in them way,”
I corrode for dignity.</p>

<p>“Southern Pacifick Railway were not built
in them way, you can bet it,” say Irish.</p>

<p>“It will be a cheap way to travel in future,”
I nudge.</p>

<p>“It are not cheap way to travel in present,”
decry that Hon. Irish. “By counting up all
axidents, break-ups, refusals to go, unwillingness
to stay up when started there, etc., it are computed
by Scientists that airships has cost $1,000
for every yard they has flew through air.”</p>

<p>“Such an expensive car-fare!” I derange.</p>

<p>“Rates like them should be regulated by
Congress,” negotiate Hon. Irish, collecting
together fractional pieces of airship what was
strewed apart over hillside.</p>

<p class="tb">Arthur Kickahajama, missionary boy, are being
a heathen awhile this summer because it are
vacation, and because his derby was thieved by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
somebody at a Church Sociable. Missionary
lady say him, “Arthur, you should be a sunshine.”
He-say, “Too much sunshine creates headache.
I think I shall put up a umbrella for a temporary
time.”</p>

<p>Therefore Arthur are very sinical &amp; pessimons
when he speak of air navigation &amp; human races.</p>

<p>“Airships,” say Arthur, “are like souls of
people. There are continuous talk about elevating
human race; but alarmingly seldom does souls
get far enough off the ground to create much
disturbance.”</p>

<p>“Some souls is like baloons,” I mitigate.
“They has lofty tendencies, they are filled of gas.
They go up &amp; stay there where it is.”</p>

<p>“It are easy to be ideal like a baloon,” say
Arthur. “But it are hard to be ideal like a airship.
To go up on lofty thought &amp; stay up there
floating around without getting nowhere, that
are job what lots persons do &amp; say, ‘O my, I are
so High Mind!’ But to go for trip in high air &amp;
know where you will arrive at—<i>that</i> are job
for seldom and rare individuals. Such toply
navigators can discover North Pole and become
familiar with stars. They are not baloonists—they
are Poets....”</p>

<p>“Poets are continually getting bumped to
Earth,” I indulge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>“Excuse me so,” say Arthur, obtaining cigarettes
from me, “when not a Christian I am a
free-thinking Japanese.”</p>

<p>“When thinking freely you are most relidgous,”
I commute.</p>

<p class="tb">So we close up by singing of following song-sing
which sound very peculiar to musick of
samisen, which is a Jewish harp made in Yeddo:</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CONVENTIONAL MEETING OF REPS IN CHICAGO</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, June 15th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper which are a good
advertising and spiritualistick medium about
proper subjecks, but must not mention pat.
medicines because of doped results.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Asteamed Sir</span>—It are not merely Japanese
alone which is surprised &amp; excited over Rep
National Convention meeting in Chicago. All-coloured
persons is stimulated by it including Hon.
Strunsky, Irish salooner by corner.</p>

<p>“It will be very august assembly,” corrode Hon.
Strunsky by beer-glass.</p>

<p>“It will be June assembly in newspapers,” I
devote. I am suspicious of something humoristick
by American eye-wink from that Strunsky.</p>

<p>“Them Rep National Convention will be like
a whale-fish,” he persume.</p>

<p>“Why will it be so whalish by nature?” I ask
to know.</p>

<p>“Because of,” he-say. “It will be very large,
very cool and full of spouts.”</p>

<p>“Are it not wrong politick for Republicans to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
so fishy?” I am next to require, but Hon. Strunsky
become busy with intemperate customers.</p>

<p>Newspaper reading of press makes all Japanese
Boys feverish of mind about such Conventions
which are representative and something else.
Presidents is manufactured &amp; pulled apart by
such a Conventions. Are it not instructiverus for
Japanese Boys to learn how to do such things
with Presidents? So we have such a Convention
for ourselves &amp; trade pretty numberous
thoughts to-gether in dine-room of Patriots
of Japan Board &amp; Lodging. Many ideas are
burst by this.</p>

<p>Bunkio Saguchi, Japanese taylor, sound keynote
to say,</p>

<p>“I represent a violent Tafty sentiment; therefore
I should be interrupted by cheers.”</p>

<p>This are arranged from all.</p>

<p>“I make an emotion,” discourse this Bunkio,
“that Hon. Taft be named by exclamation.”</p>

<p>“We are eager to make Tafty exclamations,”
rotate F. Matsu, “but Hon. Roosevelt must be
nominated first by request.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Nox are more safely Pennsylvanian to
vote for,” erupt W. Furo who are a humourist
because of his lame mind.</p>

<p>Arthur Kickahajama, missionary boy, say-so,
“Tarified statesmen must stand patsy, resulting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
in pius victory for Jo-uncle Cannon. He are a
splandid Lincoln Republican because of.”</p>

<p>“Because of which?” transfer Nogi.</p>

<p>“Because of sentimental whiskers,” dally Arthur.</p>

<p>“You are a Favourite Son,” say Nogi, who is
expert in mean curses.</p>

<p>More insults is enjoyed. Then there is hits
followed by jiu jitsu. Chair furniture is smashy
to window including text-book &amp; Japanese break-a-brack.
Intermission by Police.</p>

<p>Japanese Boys Rep Convention adjurned
<i>sine diet</i>.</p>

<p class="tb">“O what is so scarce as a day in June?” require
to know Hon. Seth Lowell, American poeter.
Answer to this is, “Republican Convention in
June are still more scarcer.” It will of surely be
a nice weather-condition for Chicago in June
to have all them assorted minds going assimulusly
in middle of Lake Shore. All sections of Chicago,
which are not already occupied by Mayor Busse,
will be full of Hon. W. Taft. Flags bunted everywhere
with thrills. Patriotism enjoyed by all.</p>

</div>

<p>Since great World’s Fire of 1898 Hon. Chicago
have not saw anything outside of Hon. Stockyards
so beautiful &amp; talented. If you got some
kind of brain, Mr. Editor, imagine with it!
Imagine 992 desperate statesmen which has all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
signed the pledge to vote for something, then
approach together for purpose. Could eye-flash
be omitted, could heart-sob be out, could speeching
with voice be neglected for such occasion?
Answer is, No! Put imaginative opera-glass on
them great Congregation. East &amp; West, North
and some sections of South, hit together in firm
bond of union with common devotion of patriotick
thought, “Let us see Chicago and go home!”
Loyal Sons of same fairish land parading under
banner of the Nice Old Party with following
placards to show how harmonious they feel:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We Want Teddy.”</p>

<p>“We Don’t.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Fairbanks is Tall &amp; Fair.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Cannon is a Big Boom.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Cannon Are a False Report.”</p>

<p>“We Want Senator Forker.”</p>

<p>“We Want Rockefeller—But We Can’t Have
Him.”</p>

<p>“A Close Shave for Gov. Hughes.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Taft Will Put Down the Trusts.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Cannon Will Put Them Down More
Gently.”</p>

<p>“Roosevelt Forever!”</p>

<p>“It Looks That Way.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Editor, if you can imagine them things it will
not be necessary for you to buy ticket to Chicago.
And yet them Convention will be a great service
to see because so much of. Every State in this
Hon. Union will be misrepresented by some great
man or another. Oftenly two or three statesmen
will do this. Brains will enjoy fatigue from
enormous Thought. Prominent druggers of Chicago
will get some permits to sell headache powders
to Delegates before &amp; after speeches. When
nothing else seem important the Hon. Band will
play Star Spangly Banner (national tune) and Hon.
Delegates will play Poker (national game). Excitement
will never lax.</p>

<p>Little Annie Anazuma, eight-year-aged daughter
of I. Anazuma, Japanese barber, are excited
about them Convention because she have a conventional
mind.</p>

<p>“I read by papers, Uncle Togo,” she-say,
“that Republican Convention will spend $3,000
for music.”</p>

<p>“Musical chins is expensive,” I deploy.</p>

<p>“Tell me to know, Uncle Togo,” she submit,
“what are a Temporarial Chairman about which
so much reading is done of lately?”</p>

<p>“A Temporarial Chairman are a musician
hired to toot key-note for such a Convention,”
I arrange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span></p>

<p>“What will be key-note of Republican Convention?”
require that childish Japanese.</p>

<p>“You are too young to imagine,” I collapse.
“There must be 47 key-notes to please all variety
of Republicans.”</p>

<p>“Such a chairman should be a brass band,”
signify little Annie.</p>

<p>I am silent for reply.</p>

<p>“Why are Senator Borrows called ‘Julius
Cæsar’?” are next question for that infant mind.</p>

<p>“Julius Cæsar are name of antique Statesman
who was stabbed,” I berate.</p>

<p>“Will Hon. Borrows enjoy such a stabbing?”
she talk off.</p>

<p>“Possibly never,” I derange. “Hon. Borrows
will resume Hon. Chair as a very much instructed
Delegate. He are instructed to look patriotick,
but not to act too nervous about it. He must not
do nothing to stampede them Convention. A
room full of Delegates are like a yard full of mule-horses.
They are shy about sudden noises. They
have animal natures. They are very anxious to
enjoy a stampede. If Hon. Temp. Chairman
say ‘Roosevelt!’ of sudden with voice, then such
kick-over, snort, hoof-tramp, squeal &amp; panderonium
might ensue that Hon. Roosevelt might be
nominated before Hon. Fire Dept. could burst in
&amp; put out enthusiasm of with wet hoses. Temp.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Chairman must arouse Republicans in soothing
sort of way. He are allowed to mention patriots
of Bunko Hill; but about San Juan Hill nothing
to said. American Colonial History are nice thing
for such occasions.</p>

<p>“‘Patriots &amp; Senator Penrose,’ would be quiet
sort of beginning. ‘What happen on bleak New
English coast by several centuries of past-time?
Hon. Plymouth Rock was discover by boat
<i>Mayflower</i>.’</p>

<p>“(‘Several cheers for Presidential Yacht!’
outcry California Delegate with stampeding
motion of thumbs.)</p>

<p>“‘Pilgrim Parents grew that Rock and we can
prove it,’ delude that Hon. Temp, ‘and Republican
Party are deliciously like them Plymouth Rock,
emblem of free &amp; brave, beautiful American
ideal covered with moss and in garments green
indistinct in the twilight. Quotation from Longfellow——’</p>

<p>“(‘Our ticket, Fairbanks &amp; Longfellow!’ say
voice from Indiana.)</p>

<p>“‘Plymouth Rock have stood stationary for
1,000’s of year and refused to move itself for nothing
or nobody. That are a very dignified lesson
for Republican Party to stand on.’</p>

<p>“(‘Banzai for Cannon &amp; Fort!’ decry voice
with New Jersey accent.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“‘Plymouth Rock are a silent tribute of strength.
One safely sane Republican President should be
such a silent tribute. What say Hon. Dan Webster
about Presidential candidates? He-say, “A
roaring stone pleases no boss.” Therefore let us
do nice job by Republican faith, a faith what is
builded on stones of ancestors and rocks of Wall
Street.’</p>

<p>“(Faint shrieking of ‘Teddy!’ from uninstructed
Arizona delegate. Stampede repressed by fire-drill.)”</p>

<p>“Are Hon. Cæsar choice of Administration?”
enquire little Annie.</p>

<p>“So sorry to reply,” I dement. “Hon. Beverage
are more sweethearted to Hon. Administration,
but patriotick Senators say he are too intemperate
with talk.”</p>

<p>“Prohibition Republicans is opposed to all
Beverages,” abrogate little Annie, resuming doll-play
of childhood.</p>

<p class="tb">Hon. Taft got back shortly ago from Panama
Canal where he was sent to study Republican
Majority. He are now nervous about a trip to
Philippine Islands where he is anxious not to be
needed till after Convention have got through with
him. Hon. Taft do not seek no nomination, but
he are willing to occupy address where he can be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
found if looked for. Philippine Islands is too
distant for such modesty. If duty called Hon. Taft
to such farness away, I bet my bootware he would
hear duty making race-riot in Chicago during
middle of June.</p>

<p>Hon. Taft are largest Policyholder in Roosevelt
Insurance Society. He will be nominate so
easily that it appear deceptive. I know because I
am aware. I am sometimes full of rejoice that I
have not got a ticket for that Hon. Convention
because it would be a tired thing to set for 5-day
race in them Convention Hall to hear something
happen what you know is arranged in advance.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, newspaper-press of all-coloured
politicks has enjoyed considerable agony about
White Shadow of Administration hovvering over
them Convention.</p>

<p>I presume of my knowledge that Hon. Roosevelt
are setting in them Light House at Washington
suffering from pains in laughing-bone. He hear
them Malefactors nervously chattering teeth about
III Term, he are conscious about excitement from
Subsidized persons which looks over shoulders for
fearful of More of It; he are aware of very
solidified O-Hio curses with instructions to
Look Out.</p>

<p>But Hon. Roosevelt, setting in barber-chair at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
Light House, are smoking smoke and carving on
deathly end of Big Club following instructions,</p>

<p>“<i>To be Preserved in Alcohol until Needed in
1912.</i>”</p>

<p>“You have been President once and ½,” say
Jacob Riis from press chair.</p>

<p>“Of sure I have,” say Hon. Pres., “and I gave
American audiences a very nice performance.”</p>

<p>“Every good performance deserve an encore,”
admire Hon. Riis.</p>

<p>“I have been hunting them for several year,”
say Hon. Roosevelt for parlayzed expression of
thought. “And many of them are still alive &amp;
savage.”</p>

<p>“What you speak of,” enquire Hon. Riis,
“them Trusts?”</p>

<p>“No,” renig Hon. Roosevelt, “them Bears.”</p>

<p>“What else to do when all is over?” require
Hon. Jake.</p>

<p>“I shall go to Wales and hunt rabbits.”</p>

<p>“Why such distances away?” derange him.</p>

<p>“Wales is nice country for rests. In Wales
they do not know a rebate from a rabbit.”</p>

<p>After this is loud scratching from pencils.</p>

<p>Hoping you will send me a free wire telegraf
if Hon. Roosevelt gets elected by mistake,</p>

<span class="smaller">AMERICA’S BANG UP CEREMONY</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, June 30th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York newspaper which act grand
to my hummbelness.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>—I am a familiar case. Therefore
permit me to ask one humour reproach about
something very mixed which are going to happen
to these U. S. July 4th are it. This ceremony
have occur so oftenly to America that persons
should be used to it. Persons is mostly able to
get used to whatever happen in eventual time.
Japan have gradual became innocule to hon.
beri-beri, which are a fine disease, if you must
have one. Hawaii islands also feels ditto about
lepordsy, which are regarded a pretty custom
among natives who got it. China are used to
opium-smoke, England are used to Parliament.
Then why-so these America never get used to
July 4th? I ask to know.</p>

<p>Answer is this: She never will! She think may-be-so
she might, when something discouridge
occur. By July 4th morning she take some nervous
medecine to soothe it. She feels strongly better.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Joyful pops in distance. “Ha!” she say for
bluff, “I am vaccinated with gunpowder,” Louder
and more smashy become fusileer of bang-bang
musick until some fraxures bust to window.
Then silences. “Heavenly praise!” say Hon.
America, “in another minutes I should do a
scream.” Of suddenly large curl of smoke are
saw, then roof-afire followed by chicken-yard
blazes. Local hook-corps come with hose in time
to rake together ashes of sweet home &amp; fireshade.
Then Hon. America forget calm resolve &amp; enjoy
some hysterick.</p>

<p>Sydney Katsu Jr., who are my affectionate
chumb, make a humoristick remark when I tell
him this parabula about Hon. America. He say,
“Hon. America can’t no more get used to July 4th
than she can get used to Hon. Roosevelt.” I hope
you will convulse yourself with this joke, because
it sound very delicious in Japanese.</p>

<p>I enquire of some frequent Americans why-so
it are necessary to blow up America once annually
to make them patriotick. I am replied by
snickkers from many. Yet others indulge me
with following answer: “We must make considerable
Jar in order to remind us of American
Flag.” So fooly excuse! Do Hon. Japan have
to blow herself up once annually in order to
remind her of that dear sun-banner? Answer is,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
No!! When Hon. Japan wish to remind herself
of Japanese Flag she go blow up Hon. Russia,
which will do pretty well.</p>

<p>By last July 4th, while roming up San Francisco
for silent reflecion on patriotism, etc., I am shook
around by Port Arthur explosions from all direction.
It were as if Hon. Inferno had got away
&amp; was scratching himself with thunderbolts.
Please imagine it. Popcorn sounds from small
firework was aggrevated by occasional intense
jar of mammal torpedo. At corner of St. I seen
one intelligent American laddish boy age 9
a-blowing on dynamite fuse to make her go up.</p>

<p>“Before finishing yourself,” I snuggest with
kind face, “please told me why you wish make
such an explode.”</p>

<p>“Because of Revolutional War,” surrogate
them tiny child.</p>

<p>“Do firecrack blow-up give you some intelligent
instructions about Revolutional War history?”
I request for answer.</p>

<p>“Of sure it do!” declaim them kidly youth
procuring flames from matchbox.</p>

<p>“If you can bang yourself wise,” I dally,
“please name 8 generals what faught with Hon.
Washington at Valley Forges.”</p>

<p>“Name them yourself,” say them child, “can’t
you be able to see how busy I are?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p>And when he thusly say-it all them firework
burst up &amp; he are blowed to ambulance. I was
sorry to seen such sweet child rumpled by fireworks,
so I go hunt Hon. Parents of him &amp; say
following for tearful eye,</p>

<p>“Dear sir, I explain it that your child are considerably
bursted.”</p>

<p>“Boys will be boys,” say Hon. Parents for
Christian Science expression.</p>

<p>“Boys will be angels when not careful,” I
relapse with Red Cross eyewink.</p>

<p class="tb">I got personal trouble sufficiently without July
4th to come &amp; add some weariness. My uncle
Nichi, Japanese carpenter of Yeddo, have arrive
to S. F. for a very stretched visit. He are a
entirely jay Japanese, considerably neglectful of
American pant &amp; vest, so he stick by kimono
which should be ashamed. I fix a nice derby
hat on him, which is fashionable, yet I can seen
persons make snickker-lip when he pass-by.
American derby annex to Japanese kimono are
nice symbol of modern Japan. It appear quite
hellish.</p>

<p>Should I drop Uncle Nichi like a nusance?
Ah no! I must retain him reverently because he
are a ¼ cousin to my ancestor. Therefore I
entertain him to beer-ceremony at saloon of Hon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
Strunsky, Irish patriot. Uncle Nichi think beer
should be served in a cup &amp; saucer. He-say
this kingdom give him musical ears &amp; a
brain-ache.</p>

<p>“Were America discover by axidents?” he
enquire to know.</p>

<p>“Almost entirely,” I congratulate.</p>

<p>“With care it might have been avoided,” emit
that oldy man.</p>

<p>“Hon. America were discover by Mr. Columbus,
July 4, 1776,” I say for slight bore of tone.</p>

<p>“Tell me everything,” attack Uncle Nichi,
who expect to stay here indefinitely.</p>

<p>“On them date I said it,” is further from me,
“Hon. Columbus approach to Boston with iron
fleet. To assist him was Gen. Washington &amp;
Gen. Grant, both nice fighters and anxious to
get into American history. Pretty soonly they
seen monument of Bunco Hill &amp; there—beholt
it!—was Brittish troop with flag by command of
Gen. Corn Wallace——”</p>

<p>“Excuse me to interrupt,” degrade my ¼
ancestor. “If Hon. Columbus discovery these
U. S. first what was Brittish troop doing there
already?”</p>

<p>“Most schoolboys is familiar with story,” I
dib with proud cigar. “So I may proceed, thank
you. Hon. Columbus land to shore with blue-jacky<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
&amp; quick-fire ammunition. ‘You must
fight us, please,’ he-say to Brittish troop. ‘O
no, not to do!’ they renig with accent, ‘We must
not fight on July 4th because it are a legal holiday,’
Therefore Hon. Columbus ship them Brittish
troop to Niagara Fall &amp; declare these U. S. an
entirely free kingdom.”</p>

<p>“And next what?” surrogate Uncle Nichi
wakefully.</p>

<p>“And nextly Hon. Washington go to Pittsburgh
where he was crowned President &amp;
Gen. Grant go Appotomax where he last all
summer.”</p>

<p>“And what happen to Hon. Columbus?”
corrode Unc.</p>

<p>“He go back to Spain where he was lynched,”
I collapse.</p>

<p>“So July 4th have been occurring regularly ever
since?” he ask it.</p>

<p>“With regular explosions,” I narrate.</p>

<p>“Firecracks are an invention of the devil,”
twitch Uncle Nichi for superstitious look.</p>

<p>“They are an invention of the Chinese,” I
retard, “and that may be quite similar.”</p>

<p>“Most crimes can be traced to China,” say
Nichi for racial prejudice.</p>

<p>“So July 4th will arrive presently,” I make
known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>“How shall I know when it is came?” he ask
to know.</p>

<p>“How can you miss it?” I bewail.</p>

<p>“Please relate 25 or 30 noble instances of
American patriotism,” begin Uncle Nichi, but I
am able to delude him away for care-fare ride
price 10c.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, by most nearly genuine statistick
$3,000,000 are burned off of America by each
annual July 4th. This are sufficient to built 1 of
them battleships what Congress feel too poor to
vote. Six hundred persons is entirely killed by
this yearly bang-up. Such a number would
make a very nice crew for such a battleship.
They might sail it &amp; never enjoy death until old
age do it. Would it not be a splandid plan for all
Americans to avoid purchase of firework for 1
year &amp; sent the money to Senator Hobson to
buy such a patriotick boat? It might be painted
of red colour to resemble firecrackers &amp; would
be a floating monument to all brave Americans
who did not die on July 4th. I suggest an earnest
thought.</p>

<p>Ah, Mr. Editor, I can hear you said something
with sweet voice! I can hear you said, “That
Japanese Schoolboy have a soul minus feet;
else why he make such a rail against July 4th,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
when all them firework what is burned for glory
are of Japanese parentage?” Quite so truthful
it are for you to speek this, Mr. Editor. Sky-racket,
pinny-wheel, flower-pottery, nigger-chase
&amp; Romantic-candle fireworks was formerly of
Japanese parentage, but they was very temperate
&amp; well-behaving when made in Japan. It were
when they began to be manufactured in New
Jersey that they became boystrous, disappated
&amp; disorderly shoots.</p>

<p>By olden date of time it were custom for cash-wealthy
Daimo what was feeling joyful about his
ancestors to invite selection of persons to come
his garden to have a see. Pretty soon it was dark,
then Hon. Daimo would set afire one flower-pottery
filled with gunpowder. Sky was filled
with fiery blossoms to resemble botany.</p>

<p>“That are a lily-plant of firework,” say Hon.
Daimo, “How you like?”</p>

<p>“O how sweet!” declaim all guests bumping
forehead with hissy politeness. Then they drink
tea &amp; go home with calm medetations about great
emperors &amp; other famous politicians.</p>

<p>Japan do not make such blazes very muchly
now days. She too busy with ordinary killing
machinery to devote times to decorated deaths.
When Japan have got to nail together 6 new
<i>Dreadnothings</i> annually for all-time of future in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
order to keep civilized, what chanst have she got
to shoot off Romantic-candles for ancestors? But
she do it slyly now &amp; then.</p>

<p>And yet I are not entirely cross &amp; irritate when
I see small kidly boys a-blowing off noises on them
July 4 date. Memory of Concors &amp; Lex. are
worth burning some fingers for; but to blow out
eyes for such a memory are wastefully unnecessary.
Independance Day are a variety of intemperance,
and yet I might weep with eye to see it abolish by
Prohibition. What say Dan Webster about this?
He-say, “Intemperance are a good thing when
took moderately.” A very slight July 4th could
not hurt anybody—not even a College Professor
what often injure his fine brains a-thinking about
Standard Oil &amp; how get some.</p>

<p>Therefore I take ferryboat to some shades of
wood next July 4th and there enjoy lonesome picknick.
Sandwitch &amp; cigarette will be smoked by me,
followed by this poem, which are less complete still:</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper who do it like
Hon. Sampson &amp; murder deceptive tigers
with ham-bone of a mule.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—In Jambeezi Creek, majistickal
river of darky Africa, nervous tense of suppressed
excitement &amp; impatient longing are being enjoyed
by splandid menagerie of brutal beasts &amp; curios
residing there. Seldom have foliage of uncut
Nature made such a nice invitation for a distinguished
visitor to come and shoot at it. Seldom
in Chicago was such 45-minute demonstration
gave to One Man by a convention of entirely
wild animals. Seldom in history of Nature-fake
have Hon. Tom Seton or Hon. John Burro
observed animals doing such behaviour without
going to jail. Imagine with your brain, Mr.
Editor, such squeak-rore &amp; bellus of 10,000
elephants assisted by tigers and other dennisons
of forest which has talent for making noises if
nothing else! It are like a suffragette caucus
in winter quarters of Barnum &amp; Bailey; it are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
the voice of Nature becoming hoarse with ovation
of banzai for the King of the Juggle, a Ramrod
among hunters, the only entirely retired Emporer
that ever told the Truth about Africa at the rate
of $2 a word and $4 for hard ones!</p>

<p>In deeps of juggly forest Mother Elephant set
neath cocanuts &amp; hold Baby Elephant in her
arms.</p>

<p>“What aily you, tender Infant?” she require
for worry, brushing back its goldy locks.</p>

<p>“Female mother,” he prattle, “what date of
calendar do it be?”</p>

<p>“To-day are Thursday, Aug. 13, by N. Y.
<i>Journal</i>,” she reclaim for nervous calm.</p>

<p>“Ah sad!” sob Hon. Child, winding trunk
around neck of its female mother. “It are such
a length of time till!”</p>

<p>“Till which?” blow-out she.</p>

<p>“Till March 4th,” remark child, “when Hon.
Roosevelt may obtain a vacation for 4 years &amp;
come Africa to shoot Father.”</p>

<p>“Hush, child,” say Hon. Mother Elephant.
“Hon. Roosevelt have got other large game besides
Elephants on his hands. He have got Mr. Taft.”</p>

<p>“And when Mr. Taft are entirely elected,
what then-so?”</p>

<p>“And then-so your Mother &amp; Father will
both receive some very distinguished shoots from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
that great mans. And maybe, if you are a very
good little Baby Elephant and do not climb no
trees, maybe you too will get a nice little bullet
from Hon. Roosevelt.”</p>

<p>So Baby Elephant go sleep on shoulder-blade
of Mother without no more lullabys.</p>

<p class="tb">Among banana trees of river-bank reside Jib-jab,
the man-chewing Tiger, who is a friend of Mr.
Kipling’s. He set by bright pooly-water worshiping
his mustash which is bees-wax upward to make
look like Emperor Wm. When along come
Jug, the poisoned cober-snake, entirely filled with
prussic acid &amp; sliding along on the seat of his
stummick. He are reading Hon. Kipling’s
“Juggle Book” so as learn some nice snake-language
for make welcome speech of Hon.
Roosevelt when he arrive.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Jib-jab,” he say to friend,
biting him on tail for playful salute. “Are
Presidential Program collaborately prepare for
to be shot off when Hon. Pres. make arrival?”</p>

<p>“Of sure it are!” say Tiger with Frank Hitchcock
expression. “I have enjoyed considerable
literary correspondence with Hon. Sec. Loeb
who make appointment with me for meet Hon.
Roosevelt on date of May 8, 1909, when I will be
entirely shot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“How you do to receive such honour?” snuggle
Hon. Snake.</p>

<p>“On them May 8, 1909, I are instruct to be
standing neath cocanuts with very tigerly expression
of angry rage. Growls from me. From
under-bush suddenly leap outly 72 dare-devilish
hunters armed to teeth with photographer’s
supplies. <i>Snap-snap</i>—I snagger back, riddled
with kodaks. In vainly I endeavour to escape,
but ere I can do a sneak I are surrounded
by James Creelman, Jacob Riis, Dave Grame
Phillips, Jack London, Bat Masterson, W. K.
Bok, Arthur Brisbane, &amp; other desperate scouts
famous for shooting wild game at 25c a word
and 50c for hard ones. Trembling in 4 lims
&amp; tail I am interviewed &amp; compared to Thomas
F. Ryan. All are complete then, except the
Finish.</p>

<p>“Silence suddenly over all Africa. Birds in
top-trees cease tune-whistling. Monkeys in up-twig
cease practising after-dinner speeches.</p>

<p>“Then in the midst of hushes, One Man step
forthly. It are.</p>

<p>“‘Hon. Ted,’ say Hon. Riis, ‘this are Hon.
Tige.’ Paw-shakes are did with exhibitions of
teeth from both us. ‘Dee-light!’ say Hon. Roosevelt
($4 for this word) and step backly to 30 pace.
‘Head little to right, please’ ($10) he dib, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
Crack-Jordan rifle are placed to elbow. ‘Bang!’
($2) say rifle &amp; I fall down on Africa and give
up my sinful soul with a mean snarl. After them
exercises I am entirely skinned &amp; speeches worth
$680 is indulged in averaging from 25c to $4 a
word. Since King Midas died from swallowing
his gold teeth no King of Beasts has passed off so
expensively.”</p>

<p>“Land of sakes!” abjeck Hon. Snake with
poison face, “I am filled with venum to think
what famous Brute you will be while I am merely
wormly &amp; equal to zero with a wiggle on it.
While you are meeting all them fashionable
literary persons, I must get stepped on &amp; nothing
else.”</p>

<p>“Cease to grouch!” commute Hon. Tige. “If
you get industrious &amp; bite somebody maybe you
will get beaten to jello with Big Club, and thusly
have name in newspaper-prints among other
noted malefacktors.”</p>

<p class="tb">My Cousin Nogi, who are enjoying grouchies
this week because Miss Furioki to which he are
still married as wife has made a lope with S.
Wanda, Japanese Socialist, come-me and say
following for politickal rebuke:</p>

<p>“On March 4, 1909, scenery of disturbance will
shift from Washington to Africa.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>“Hon. Roosevelt are very fond of dum animals,”
I hob-nob. “They can not talk back for
repartee.”</p>

<p>“It are a great rest-cure to become an entirely
desperate hunter. While stabbing a tiger it are
very difficult to remember party lines &amp; other
ugly liars. Grasping them furyus lepard by
juggly vein with cruel eyes standing on end &amp;
teeth firmly planted in shoulder for delicious bite—on
them occasion how tame must seem companionship
of E. H. Harriman, Hon. Fork Tillman,
&amp; Hon. Jo Forker!”</p>

<p>“What-say Hon. Rubbert Burn, famous Scotch,
about this?” I reject. “He-say:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Let old acquaintance be forgot</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And never brought to mind.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At this quotation Sydney Katsu, Jr., make
come-in to my room for borrow toothbrush.</p>

<p>“What grand American have wrote some light
tex-book on angry animals to be shot in Africa?”
he ask-it.</p>

<p>“Some distinguished African might do this
intelligently,” I snuggest for help.</p>

<p>“I have perused inside of entire edition of
Hon. Booker Washington,” repose Sydney, “and
there I find chapter on ‘Care &amp; Culture of Mules
by Young Coloured Niggers’—and yet he are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
suspiciously silent about brutal beasts to be
murdered on Jambeezi Creek.”</p>

<p>“African subjecks is kept very dark by educated
Africans,” I drib for laughing-joke which
sound delicious in Japanese.</p>

<p>“I enjoy considerable puzzle,” corrode Sydney.
“If no light books is to be had about them
carnibblous animals of darky Africa, how we
know what expect when Hon. Roosevelt go
shoot it?”</p>

<p>“At $2 a word one may expect anything,”
I dib. “Hon. Gulliver wrote delicious travels for
much less.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Gulliver were a short &amp; ugly tourist,”
notate Nogi.</p>

<p>Then in come Uncle Nichi, my ¼ ancestor,
wearing congressional shoes which irritate his
straw-seed appearance of Japanese farmer. He
banish in hand 1 piece tab-paper of which he are
foolishly proud.</p>

<p>“So glad!” he rake-out. “I got here a sweet
list of all mad animals what reside there in dam
section of Congo riverside.”</p>

<p>“Who give you such lists?” I require for shame
because he is my bloody relation.</p>

<p>“Hon. Strunsky, Irish salooner, who say he
has been to all parts of Africa &amp; Indiana.”</p>

<p>“Read it, please,” say Sydney Katsu, Jr., who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
are oftenly polite because he are not related to
Uncle Nichi.</p>

<p>So Uncle Nichi with jay spectacles read following
deceptive list of brutal beasts to be shot from
foliage of Africa by persons what sees them:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Piebrock</i>—a six-legged steer what subsist on
malt beveridges which he take through a
straw because he have no teeth. He pulls
corks with a horn which grows from the back
of his neck. He can be easily told from a
<i>fagdoo</i> because he are a different animal.
He are fond of distinguished visitors and
enjoys Washington gossip when entirely
pure; but he are seriously dangerous when
bored. When pursued he swallows his feet-prints,
thus concealing his identity. Scarce
during Presidential Years.</p>

<p><i>Yelk</i>—a species of pantomome, full of delicious
flavours, but awful hostile when killed.

<span class="smaller">THE HON. GASOLENE</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, July 5th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper, celebrated for
its Nationality and nice printing.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—What say Hon. Galileo when
enjoying execution by ax? He say, “This World
do move!” Then neck-chop ensue to interrupt
that great thought at wind-pipe. If Japanese
Boy was there he would enquire to know, “What
do move this World, please?” Answer for this
reply is: “Hon. Gasolene do!”</p>

<p>One quaint American proverb say, “Where
there is Smoke there is Blazes.” This is especially
truthful about Pittsburgh. Yet how much more
proverbial it would be to say it, “Where there is
Smell there is Speed.” I know because!</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I do not possess of my ownership
any automobiles, but my cousin Nogi gave me
acquaintance to Hon. G. W. Yosho, celebrated
coachman for all tour-cars. This Yosho wear
rubber uniform of Japanese Field Marshal. He
appear to look like Marquis Oyama, but is much
more important about it. I reverence him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
because he have killed several Americans and some
Christians.</p>

<p>“Hon. Yosho,” I collapse with Japanese
salute, “nobody not yet have invited me to ride
in one.”</p>

<p>“Maybe so it might,” he subdivide with forgetful
expression.</p>

<p>“Do automobiles make persons civilized?”
I require for answer.</p>

<p>“Ask the Motor Man!” signify this Hon.
Yosho making buzz-buzz of machinery and
disappear with considerable odour. Soonly I
hope to become a dear acquaintance to this Yosho
who would be a very nice friend for chumb.</p>

<p>Next I go to livery stable where automobiles
is kept. There I met Motor Man who suspect me
of being Japanese Count ambitious to buy one.
I become immediately deceptive. He suffocate
me with international courtesy. He show me
several tour-cars of delicious machinery.</p>

<p>“How much for price of red automobile?”
I enquire to know.</p>

<p>“Red automobile is $8,000 by price, Mr.
Count,” he collapse with politeness.</p>

<p>“How much for price of green automobile?”
I ask for haughty reply.</p>

<p>“Green automobile is $2,000 for price, Hon.
Sir,” he dictate for reverence.</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus13" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus13.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">“There I meet Motor Man who ... suffocate me with international courtesy”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“Quite well,” I retrograde. “Then paint
red automobile green and Japanese Boy will take
it for $2,000.”</p>

<p>This Motor Man hesitate to do. So he donate
to me one cigar of value 25c and we enjoy a very
elaborate interview about Hon. Gasolene which
is a wonderfully civilized drug. By ancient history,
say this Motor Man, Hon. Gasolene was a
very hummbel medicine. It was principally useful
for removing raspberries from gloves and could
be employed in cook-stoves for explosions. Gasolene
was next discovered to be one nice chemical
for insurance. This gave it publick interest
which made it necessary for all forms of motor.
(“What is home without a motor?” require little
Annie Anazuma, who have a flashy mind for
9 year age.)</p>

<p>Gasolene is so easy to distinguish from cologne
that it appear deceptive. “Though lost to sight
to memory strong” and “Gone, but not forgotten”
was once fashionable for funerals. Them
remarks is now mostly heard at automobile
races.</p>

<p>Hon. Gasolene will make great civilization for
future, say Motor Man. Niagara Falls will be
runned by this fuel, machinery of Congress will
go by gasolene-motor, farmers will turn horse-stable
into garage and gather hay by gasolene.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Warfare of future, say Motor Man, will be shot
off by Hon. Gasolene. Japanese imperial Horse
Guards on prancing motor-cycles will make
desperation of charge on Gen. Kouropatkin with
light runabout division on left wing while automobile
batteries from hills will make considerable
banzai with Shimose powder &amp; fireworks.
By shot &amp; shell, shout-call, enjoyment of death
&amp; wounds, long red line of touring-cars will charge
from trenches while all day long them commissary-buggies
will make hurry-up trip to firing-line to
bring more gasolene from Army Canteen. Japanese
air-navy of fly-machines will do something,
too, probably, with them 1,000 horsepower
aromatic engines. O such delightful banzai!
Fierce honking from all sides, sharp report of
punctuated tires—Nippon forever! On, men
of Nagasaki! Let us shed last drop of gasolene
for home &amp; garage.</p>

<p>This is future warfare by Hon. Gasolene.
What say Hebrew Prophet? “He smelleth the
battle from away off and he yelleth ‘O my!’”</p>

<p>This Motor Man tell me some serious truth
about Hon. Gasolene when took internally by
victims. It is a very habitual drug like cocktails,
cocaine, opium-smoke and Peruna. When continually
enjoyed by human interior it make
result of one very nervous disease what hon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
doctor-book call <i>locomobile ataxia</i>. When you
have got this sickness, Mr. Editor, you will know
it by following course of symptoms:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—When tour-carring on roadway you suddenly
find out you are too slow.</p>

<p>2—You mortgage on home to buy something
of swift red colour.</p>

<p>3—You are greedy to break it. You break
record, speed-law &amp; crank-shaft in short
period. Then you break neck and quit it.</p>

<p>4—You go to hospital to forget wife &amp; child.</p>

<p>5—You deceive doctor by honking yourself to
death.</p>

</div>

<p>If you have done them symptoms, Mr.
Editor, you had better worry, because you
are a ill person.</p>

<p class="tb">One great sporty event is now approaching
to Pacific Coast by inches. It is that trip of
horse-racing automobiles travelling by snow-plough
from New York to Paris. Them automobiles
is quite international and has been froze
to death in four languages already. They expects
to enjoy Alaska &amp; Siberia in the same way.
Shuddering is unpleasant to such heroes.</p>

<p>Sydney Katsu, Jr., Japanese dentistry, desire
to make bet-sum of money with me for $1. I am<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
an entirely sporting Japanese, Mr. Editor. I
am willing to risk enormous sum of money if I
am sure I can be able to get it back with interest
at some proper percentage. I am disagreeable
about any bet what is a speculation; but I am
recklus about gambling when it is a good investment.
Therefore, what car will win? America
car is now most patriotic about getting ahead—yet
what would happen to my money if that
automobile should enjoy train-wreck while going
over Rocky Mountains in Pullman car?</p>

<p>I follow this race for one weektime by press-notice
and get these excitable items to inclose
for you:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Monday</i>—American car drawn by Hon. Bill
Pirkins’ tame mare “Florence” forges 101
yards through snow-drift.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday</i>—Italian-speaking car, driven by 2-mule-power
borrowed from Hon. Rube Brown,
make entry to Paris, Neb.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday</i>—Italian mules pass American
1-horse-power mare.</p>

<p><i>Thursday</i>—American snow-plow “Governor
Hughes” set pace for all comers.</p>

<p><i>Friday</i>—Hay is distributed along racecourse by
gallant American troups so that motor-power
can stop for lunch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p><i>Saturday</i>—French car “Motor-Block” discovered
in Chicago speaking the language.</p>

</div>

<p>“How will them motoring-cars go it in Alaska
where horses is scarce to find?” Sydney Katsu,
Jr., enquire for tip.</p>

<p>“Dogs is very obliging as beast of burden in
them arctick,” I relapse. “In Siberia reindeers
of very high gear is pleasant for automobiling.”</p>

<p>“Large supplies of Hon. Gasolene is necessary
for such trip,” say that light-mind Sydney.</p>

<p>“Large supply of Hon. Oats is more better for
fuel,” I relapse with American eye-wink.</p>

<p>Once more to speak of crime and then not to

sinful is automobiles.</p>

of last week New York newspaper-print. He-say,
“I buy it because it are a blush-colour to
resemble Hon. Police Gazat, sweet family paper.”</p>

<p>On them sporty-page, Mr. Editor, was considerable
chatter-talk about baseballing and other
crimes left over from front page. There I learn-how
one N. Y. gentleman of name McGraw have
“discovered two new stars” and I are glad,
because Astronomy are a nice knowledge to revere;
but when I read “Hon. McGraw have broken a
fresh Pitcher” I enjoy tense disgust. Why such
excitement about a milkman which are nothing
but a Swede born in Switzerland?</p>

<p>So I am very grateful to him &amp; send following
Bally question about a Game I seen &amp; got
worried:</p>

<p>“Please, when Hon. Knock batt Hon. Ball with
knock-stick till it make streek to sky &amp; of finally
lower itself followed by Second Basso &amp; 3 Herders
while Hon. Knock make running from Bass to
Bass &amp; Hon. Ball come more lowly and still lower
till 2 Herders hold uply their hands for grabb &amp;
downd come Ball &amp; aint caught because someone
negleckt to (great rory-yall from bleached seats)
so Hon. Knock he gallop-to Thirdly Bass while
all struggly to grasp Ball which do a bounce with
deceptive expression &amp; Hon. Knock stob toe &amp;
fall paralell while running, so Hon. Catch
get Ball &amp; hasten with it to where it started
from—how much would such a Play count for
both sides?”</p>

<p>To-day I receive following reply:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>“Your intelligent letter was read by our Puzzle
Editor who is dangerously dead.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>Yoni Hashimoto, Japanese boot-cobble, have
gone entirely mania on subjeck of Baseballing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
He oftenly speaks of White Sox and Giants with
voice, and many Japanese Boys supposes he is
right. Of recently he come me with National
League expression of teeth to say it.</p>

<p>“Togo, we are gathering up a Japanese baseball
9 for play with.”</p>

<p>“How many must be in such a 9?” I ask to
know.</p>

<p>“About 15 are sufficiently numberous,” expose
Yoni. “There must be 1 Catch, 1 Stopper, 3
Bassos, 1 Pitch—”</p>

<p>(“A Pitch in time saves a Nine,” I report for
cute smart quotation.)</p>

<p>“Also 3 Knockers and 6 Herders.”</p>

<p>“What are duties for them Herders, if they got
any?” is query I make.</p>

<p>“Herders is most skilful of all ballplays,”
parade Yoni. “They must be able to play inside
&amp; outside of Grounds. They must be fearless
fence-climbers &amp; able to arrive over before Hon.
Ball do. They must be reckless about colleckting
Ball on 3d or 4th bounce when all others can’t
do-so. Lots of teams loses entire games because
they has not got enough of them Herders.”</p>

<p>“If you gather up such a Japanese team who
would play with it?” I subsist.</p>

<p>“Some Christian team perhapsly,” corrode
Yoni.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>“Ah not to do!” I dib. “Christian teams is
too busy bursting Sabbath among themselves to
do baseballing with such a heathens like us.”</p>

<p>“What to do for a challenge?” submit poor
Yoni Hashimoto with entirely daff expression.</p>

<p>So I go-see Hon. Strunsky, Irish salooner, &amp;
I say him,</p>

<p>“Who would be suitable team for play-ball
with Japanese Schoolboy 9?”</p>

<p>“Old Soldiers Home might do so,” say he rolling
beer-kag.</p>

<p>“Is them Old Soldiers athletick?” I require for
answer.</p>

<p>“They are entirely cripples,” say Strunsky.
“But they are still sufficiently brisk to run circles
around such a Japanese 9 what you mention.”</p>

<p>“Are running in circles a necessary skill to do
in baseballing?” is next question for me, but Hon.
Strunsky no can answer because a U. S. soldier
arrive filled with drunk &amp; tell how he got a superior
brain to most other Irish.</p>

<p>So I go tell this Yoni man about them Old
Soldiers Home what Hon. Strunsky say might be
sufficiently athletick. Yoni he go get talefone
book and search up residence of such a Elderly
home &amp; he find one in Oakland. So sorry I no
could go, but I must assist geraniums of Mrs.
Lusy Macdonald, queenly lady of 286 pound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>

</div>

<p>Uncle Nichi, who do not understand sufficient
baseballing to do so, were permitted to go long
&amp; keep score, also do what fanning was necessary.</p>

<p class="tb">By evening-time Cousin Nogi come back looking
tired but entirely experienced.</p>

<p>“Who beat it in this game?” were first question
for me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>“When you knows you will understand,”
dignify Nogi. “Following were the Score:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>“Japanese Schoolboys</td>
    <td class="tdr">48&#160;&#160;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Old Soldiers Home</td>
    <td class="tdr">103”</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>“It must be very fine game to have such a large
score,” I snaggle.</p>

<p>“We merely play 5 Inns,” say Nogi. “Them
Elderly Vets was just beginning to get active
when twilight arrived. If game was continued to
finish them Hon. Score would of got several thousands
extra.”</p>

<p>“Tell me entire story of the game,” I collapse
patiently.</p>

<p>“It was in second Inn,” debat Nogi for Jack
London expression. “Score were then 12 to
minus in flavour of the Japanese. Hon. Pitch
for Old Soldiers were Capt. Hirum Jones, oldly
hero who lost right arm in battle of Shylock.”</p>

<p>“How can a hero be a baseball Pitch when he
lost his arm?” are my earnest enquire.</p>

<p>“His left arm were still entirely there,” dib
Nogi. “With this he make some very gentle
throws. I am next to go batt. I stand uply with
brave expression &amp; when Hon. Ball come soring
to me I make fierce knock. Ball go to heaven
with loud report. (Maddy banzai from Uncle
Nichi who was there to fan it.) I make 4 entire
home-runnings before them Hon. Vets could find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
Ball which was roosting in a tree. Then I am
put entirely out &amp; Hon. Vets enjoy a Inn.”</p>

<p>Nogi make trajick puff with cigar.</p>

<p>“Hon. Jeremiah Willkins, a sweet soldier who
lost 2 legs in Battle of Bully Run, next go batt.
He were a very nice knocker, so when he hit ball
for high sore he attempt to approach 2d Bass, but
are deliciously slow, thank you, because of footlus
condition. W. Furo grabb ball quickly &amp; Hon.
Umperor yall ‘Out, please!’ When Uncle Nichi
hear this he cry for sorrow, ‘O! not to do! what
brutal Umperor to put oldy man outside because
he lost 2 legs!’ Intense sensations for all Japanese
present. S. Wanda, Japanese socialist,
approach Hon. Willkins with polite hat. ‘Hon.
Sir,’ he say-so, ‘permit me for hellup you make
home-run,’ So Wanda, assisted by Bunkio Saguchi
&amp; Sydney Katsu, Jr., give helluping aid to
Hon. Willkins for 5 home-runs, when he say he
are tired so he set down.</p>

<p>“After that,” say Nogi, “it were a very pleasant
outing for them Hon. Vets. Eech Old Soldier
what go batt are some kind of a delicious cripple
&amp; other hon. wounds, so we must also aid <i>him</i> to
enjoy several home-runs.”</p>

<p>“How long this loving attention go on?” I ask
to know.</p>

<p>“Bye-bye darkness fall &amp; dinner-bell from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
Elderly Hero Establishment announce quit-time
for all. So handclasp were enjoyed with 3-cheer
ceremony &amp; we go ferry-boat.”</p>

<p>“103 runs were a hard afternoon for such oldy
mans,” I snuggest.</p>

<p>“It were a splandid lesson in politeness for all
National Leagues,” corrugate Nogi.</p>

<p>“It were a splandid lesson in bookkeeping for
Uncle Nichi who kept score,” was answer for
Japanese Schoolboy.</p>

<span class="smaller">IS A VICE-PRES NEARLY A KING?</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, July 12th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Editor New York Newspaper which are responsible
for everything.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—Noted Greek patriot, Erysipelas,
were once offered job of Street Cleaning Department
in Athens, Greece, which was then in a very
insane state of dirt. Intimides, Mayor of Athens,
offer him this job for a insult, because it was.
How useless however!</p>

<p>“Ah!” commute them Erysipelas, “I will took
such a publick jobs &amp; show what a elegant muck-sweep
I can do.”</p>

<p>So he done it by history.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, some patriot of America should become
like Hon. Erysipelas &amp; be a Vice-President
without doing a sulk. To be a Vice-President
are like such a Street Cleansing job, only it are
more hummbel. He are like a street-sweeper
without a broom. He are not permitted to carry
turkey-dusters or other dangerous fire-arms. He
are placed in a very high seat &amp; commanded to set
there 4 years enjoying silences. Raking, brooming<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
&amp; dusting are a forbid. If he are caught trying
to wipe cobwebs off of Senate with silk handkerchief
he are given a upbraid. He enjoy very hopeless
position—and yet he might do something
for somebody some days. If he start young being
a Vice-President might he not work up to good
position by this? Might he not, by eventual time,
get a job being 3d secretary to German Embassy
or clerk in Subtreasury Dept?</p>

<p>I ask for anxiety.</p>

<p>I have just-but &amp; recently become sad about
Vice-Presidents. Formerly I imagined it were
pretty nice kind of grandeur. Some weeks past-time
I hear wildly news &amp; go with run-step to
saloon of Hon. Strunsky who thinks politically
because he are Irish.</p>

<p>“Hon. Jim Sherman got it!” I collapse for
excitement.</p>

<p>“Who in politicks are Jim Sherman?” require
Hon. Strunsky.</p>

<p>“He are man what was nominate,” I snagger.</p>

<p>“Nominate for what?” crossly examine him.</p>

<p>“For Vice-President,” I rapture.</p>

<p>“O!” say Hon. Strunsky and continue to wipe
beer from glass.</p>

<p>I enjoy falling of face.</p>

<p>“Are not Vice-Presidency almost a kingly job?”
I ask to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“Almost,” degrade Strunsky with towel.</p>

<p>“What you mean by ‘almost’?” I research.</p>

<p>“By ‘almost’ I mean ‘nearly,’” irritate that
Irish patriot. “When a thing are ‘almost good’
it are ‘nearly bad,’” he dib. “When I chase a
ferryboat and almost catch it, that do not help me
much about arriving to Oakland in time for
German banquit. A Vice-Pres are a statesman
what have nearly caught the Ship of State.”</p>

<p>“Situation of Vice-President were offered to
many Favourite Sons,” I regret.</p>

<p>“It were refused by many Favourite Sons,”
say Strunsky, “but it were accepted by a Political
Orphan.”</p>

<p>So I leave that Strunsky enjoying feel of considerable
depress near shoulder-blade. I have
a slammed ideal. Such a useless to young mans
studying bookkeeping &amp; stenography of hope to
become President some day! It are awfully well
to make walk-up by stairway of Fame—but
supposing for imagination that foot slipped? Ah
then! Japanese Boy might get downdy tumble
to be a Vice-President or some other equal crime.</p>

<p>Soonly I meet up with my Uncle Nichi, who are
taking lessons in American cigar smoking from
Cousin Nogi. My dear ¼ ancestor are permitted
to discuss about Hon. William Jenny Bryan
because of reverence for ancient history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>“Hon. Thos. Lawson of Mass. have offer
$1,000,000 to Hon. Bryan to take it and be a Vice-President,”
say-he for news.</p>

<p>“That price would be considerable circulation
for <i>The Commutor</i>, Hon. Bryan’s newspaper,”
I collide. “But could Hon. Bryan do so much
for so little?”</p>

<p>“Honour of such office are beyond goldy riches,”
dib Uncle who is a farmer.</p>

<p>“Honour of such office are beyond caring for,”
I notify for editorial sneers.</p>

<p>“Was not Hon. Roosevelt once a Vice-President?”
corrode that relationship of mine.</p>

<p>“Many poor boys has became famous,” I
supine. “Hon. Lincoln once splitted rails, Hon.
Gen. Grant once deliver kindling. Sometimes a
Vice-President, by willing-work industry can lift
self from mean &amp; sordy surroundings which he
is in to position of self-respect &amp; desensy.”</p>

<p>“What are duties of Vice-Pres, if he got any?”
project that oldy man.</p>

<p>“Following duties,” I say, “must be did by
him to make everything pleasant, etc.:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—He must be polite to superiors which is almost
everybody around Washington. He will get
great dissatisfaction if he ain’t.</p>

<p>2—He must have neat appearance, including
brushed clothes &amp; hair. He must not come<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
down to work without a collar on his neck.
Hon. Speaker of House can be very second-handed
in appearance &amp; can eat chew-tobacco
before all; but Hon. Pres of Senate
should be at least respectable.</p>

<p>3—He must go to work sharply by 8 o’clock
each weekly day. Sunday evenings he can
entertain quiet callers in his room.</p>

<p>4—He must address Cabinet Members by their
full title, if they got it.</p>

<p>5—He must not be seen talking with friends in
hallways or lobbies.</p>

<p>6—He must not swear or wear profane neckties.</p>

<p>7—He must be white-coloured American citizen
entirely over 21 years age &amp; must be able to
write his name in plain business hand.</p>

</div>

<p>“Them is duties what a gentleman must do to
be a nice Vice-Pres of these U. S.,” I announce it.</p>

<p>“Can not anybody do them jobs without
enjoying a strain?” ask Uncle Nichi who is
a bore.</p>

<p>“Anybody can do them for a short time,”
I dib. “But man what can do them for 4
years without some serious side-steps must be
a great hero to some extent.”</p>

<p>“Such a mans is considerably limited by law,”
abstract-he.</p>

<p>“Either by law or by nature,” I notate for yawns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>(It shall be my duty to make some weep with
eye when Uncle Nichi depart away for dear
Japan; and yet I shall live beyond such sorrow.)</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, I have a sad mania about that
Vice-President. All American school-books say:
“Office of President are highest gift within power
of people—office of Vice-President are next door
to it.” Office-rent should be very high &amp; stylish
in such good neighbourhood.</p>

<p>What, then, is the matter with this office that
so many respectable &amp; wealthy statesmen refuses
to move in? Are gas-pipes in bad condition?
Do plumbing need attention to? Are Hon.
janitor careless about hot &amp; cold water? Or
what?</p>

<p>When Hon. Real Estate man have a office what
nobody will took he decorate it up with wall-paper,
etc., to look rich. Pretty soonly somebody
will be careless &amp; take it. Are not U. S. Government
splandid enough business man to repair
Vice-President office so that it will not look so
dubyus? I require no answer.</p>

<p>I am injured in nerve to see so many grand
Americans regarding that <i>To Let</i> sign with eye-wink.
Yet what-say following Statesmen about it?</p>

<p>Hon. Cannon say: “I shall be old with dignity.”</p>

<p>Hon. Fairbanks say: “I have tried it, thank you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Hon. Hughes say: “It are a hall-room.”</p>

<p>Hon. Haze Hammond say: “Too much salary
for repairs.”</p>

<p>Hon. Nox say: “I can hide elsewheres.”</p>

<p>I am confused by such proud answers. To
Sydney Katsu, Jr., I inquire: “I can not understand
why persons refuses gifts what is offered
to take free.”</p>

<p>“Sometimes it is done,” he reject coy.</p>

<p>“Presidency of U. S. are greatest gift of American
people. Therefore it are like a barrel filled
with diamonds. If I could not got such a jewlery
should I not be gleeful to accept a barrel filled
with gold?” is question for me.</p>

<p>“You might,” negotiate Sydney, “but you
might have shyness about accepting such a barrel
if it was filled with gold-bricks.”</p>

<p>Sydney are a very bright Japanese soon to go
Harvard Colledge for learn more of it.</p>

<p>Here is a slight lullaby to be chanted to children
when they are pained by tooth-cut and therefore
anxious about their politickal futures:</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I notice something pathetick by all
newspaper-prints. I notice how all say: “Hon.
Roosevelt when he refuse to be a President 3 times
made a act of noble renunciation.” But what
they say about Hon. Fairbanks when he refuse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
to be a Vice-President 2 times? They say nothing!
And yet were it not also a “noble act of
renunciation” for that lofty statesman to refuse
another run because he were afraid of becoming
too powerful? Of sure it was! Hon. Fairbanks
are a very Roman character by principals
&amp; by residence in Indiana. If Hon. Roosevelt
can be noble, then Hon. Fairbanks can be noble
also—and yet newspaper children do not make
holler about it in streets. Hon. Fairbanks must
feel pretty fine inside chest to think how he done
a great deed &amp; was a marter without nobody discovering
or even suspecting it.</p>

<p>Hon. Washington say-so that a perpetual President
would be a King. What would a perpetual
Vice-President be then? Please answer by 2c
stamp which I have forgotten to put in.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper which are eeger to
make a fare judge for thoughts of all Great
Mans, however sneeking &amp; hummbel they
may be:</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—At same moment while I are
inking these thoughts for fond reminder, two
somewhat immortal Americans is listening for
formal announcement that they are expected to be
Presidents. They have got a slight suspicion that
maybe they was mentioned for some job, but it
would be very bad tasty for them to look otherwise
than surprise when Hon. Committee with flours
make step-up and say-out, “You are a Nominate!”</p>

<p>Hon. Taft are at Warm Springs training for
strength so that he will not die a shocky death
when he learn this suddenly. At humbel village of
Lincoln, Neb., where Hon. Bryan live like a Grand
Duke of simple taste, that eminent representator of
Common Persons set by bay-window enjoying
nervous collapse.</p>

<p>“Set quiet, Hon. Wm., and look courageous like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
a photo,” say Hon. Wife to be. “Tumult &amp; shouting
die and who knows what?” “I are strangely
disturb,” say Wm., arranging his face to look like
a famous Roman janitor. “Something tell me
that maybe I are nominate to highest office in gift of
Tammany Hall. Pretty soonly Hon. Committee
must come riding up-hill to say it, and I hope
they will be darnly quick about it. At first I
must be astonished speechless—but I can seldom
remain long in such a conditions. I must hesitate
&amp; comprise myself with slightly cracked voice for
emotion, then I must read typewritten address
of 280,000 words of a entirely impromptu nature.
O surely Politicks is filled with surprises!”</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, some weeks in passed-by Hon. Taft
&amp; Hon. Bryan wrote a delicious page of large tipe
for your paper on subjeck, “My Conception
of the Presidency.” Of surely them two Presidents
know what-is they are talking about.
Speeches of Hon. Taft is found in rolls of Fame,
and speeches of Hon. Bryan is found in rolls of
Edison Phonograf. And yet there was something
deceptive &amp; sidewise about them articles they
wrote for your paper because they sounded so.
Hon. Taft say:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A President should be like Hon. Roosevelt, only less so.
He should be like a piano of upright build with some grand
square qualities. He should be the First Magistrate and also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the Principal Policeman in the kingdom. He should be good
as he are lonesome. He should treat all Trusts in a beastly
manner and uphold Truth &amp; Justice so long as it do not hurt
National Prosperity. I shall do all these things, thank you,
orders promptly attended to, telephone service day &amp; night.
Also I shall look just as much like Hon. Abe Lincoln as health
&amp; strength will permit me to do it.</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Bryan say:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>A President should be like Hon. Theodore Roosevelt only
more so. Malefactors, etc., needs not cringe off from me for
fearful that I will burn up America when I am elected. Because
I can’t. A President are only a bluff. He don’t amount to a
rolling-pin. Hon. American Govt. are a system of checks &amp;
balances, so a President are deliciously powerless when he
wish to reform it. I promise to be helpless as possible. Could
I reform Hon. Currancy from jaggy path of debochery by
feeding him Gold Cure or something? Ah no! What could I
do with them naughty Currency when Senator Alrich are
tempting him away with rakish eye-wink? To increase weakness
of my position I am willing to consult Hon. Vice-President
on all matters of no importance and talk kindly to him on
National subjecks where common-sense are not expected. I
believe in deep breathing &amp; outdoor exercise, but I are cross
about that woolley tariff of sheep and should be insulted if
offered a second term. Otherways I are willing to act like a
Majority on all occasions and what I think about Brownsvill
Affair are a matter of private conscience which I refuse to
discuss by advice of Hon. Campaign Manager.</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Editor, I entertain some scolds for you.
How sinful to ask them there Hon. Candidates
to write such opinions! When a man expect to
be a President do you expect him to tell the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
candied truth about what he think of the job?
When a man are nominate for Dog Catcher he
are often sly and deceptive before election—how
then you expect a Nominee for Pres. of the U. S.
to make crystal speeches which might be saw
through at once and spoil everything? Nobody
what are wistful about a job will tell exact truth
about what he think. If I ask for job of Hon.
Window Wash at Mills Bldg &amp; Janitor Boss say:
“Hashimura, told me transparently what you
think of this job”—what I answer for reply?
I-say: “It are a very delicate job of extreme
fineness. It are a high-horse privilege for Japanese
Boy to be able wash windows for Hon. Mills.
Though it require great skill &amp; couredge to shine
such lofty glass pains, yet I flatten myself that
I got such a power more briskly than other Japanese
Boys which is apt to be laxy in sense of duty
where it should be tightest. Hon. Janitor, I
feel myself unworthy of such a jobs, yet I know
I ain’t. Therefore give it to me because of merit.”</p>

<p>I say all them things, Mr. Editor, because I am
a candidate for them high post of Window Wash.
Therefore I am prejudicial about it. But if Hon.
Janitor ask Cousin Nogi, who do not desire such
a jobs because of his lazy spine, what-say Cousin
Nogi? He-say: “A Window Wash require some
muscles, but very little intelligence. Hashimura<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
Togo are not safe to stand on such a altitudes
because he thinks poems; therefore if he gets it
he will swim off of 10th story window &amp; burst
his fooly neck.”</p>

<p>Hon. Taft &amp; Hon. Bryan are too sympathetick
with such jobs to talk straight. Why not ask
some gentlemans what never expects to be White
Housers to give view on Presidency? Hon. Hearst
on “My Conception of the Presidency” would be
very bright &amp; could get Hon. Brisbane to write it
for him. Hon. Alt. Parker, Hon. Patty McCarren,
or Hon. John Wanamaker would talk deliciously
true &amp; sinical. But do not ask Hon. Forker,
please, because he would write it “My Conception
of the President” &amp; decuss other nigger problems
which are no longer a delicacy.</p>

<p class="tb">I. Anazuma, Japanese barber, where I go for
get my cheek whittled, say-me: “Who could
express such a conception about being a Pres., and
not lie about it?”</p>

<p>“I could,” is answer for me. “I am best
befatted for such a talk because I are
entirely unsympathetick &amp; not entitle to a
white vote like Hon. Booker Washington and
other darks.”</p>

<p>“Why you no write such a conception for
newspaper?” is snuggestion from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>“I are not yet requested,” is erupt from me.</p>

<p>“You are a modish violet,” is vocal from Hon.
Suds. “Therefore say it secretly.”</p>

<p>“If I was President,” I rake out, “I should be
divided into 2 parts. The ½ part of me should
be radikal &amp; kind of dangerous; but the other ½
portion should safely set upon the Constitution
and keep it pressed.”</p>

<p>“Would such a double lives be decent?” commit
Hon. Anazuma.</p>

<p>“In such high positions, yes,” I dabble. “A
ideel Pres. of these U. S. should be a cross between
Theodore Roosevelt &amp; Chester A. Arthur.
With one hand he should affectionately protect
the interests of the People while with the other
he should be nice to the people of the Interests.
If it are necessary for him to be 2 places at once
he must go there. When requested he must attend
a Idaho Miners’ Noyesy Barbecue full of
malice for them Hon. Malefactors; but he must
not neglect a invitation to Insurance Scandalous
Banquet where he can set by Hon. Paul Morton
and talk like a Injunction.”</p>

<p>“So shocky!” say I. Anazuma with razor. “It
are shamefully difficult to shave such a two-faced
Japanese.”</p>

<p>“In antique times of pagan Rome,” I dib, “there
was a deliciously heathen god named January who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
was able to look in 2 directions with a double
face. On one side he had a face like Hon. Judge
Landis, on the other a expression like Hon. Judge
Grosscup. When malefactors of great wealth
go to Judge Landis side of them two-face idol
they was filled with shivvers because of their sinful
rebates; so they crawl around to Judge Grosscup
side and was forgiven. But when malefactors
of great poverty get in front of them Grosscup face
to make kick against Olive Oil Trust, they almost
went to jail for their crimes, so they hurry around
to Judge Landis face and was comforted to know
that taking rebates from Harriman was sinnier
than taking silverware from a Soldiers’ Home.”</p>

<p>“I am delicious to know,” say Hon. Anazuma
who are studying to be a Y. M. C. A., “that them
heathen idol January were bursted by hatchets of
early Christian parents.”</p>

<p>“He were finally bursted,” I rebuke, “but he
last for several 1000’s of year &amp; were a nicely
successful god. He were popular like a circus
for long lines of Hon. Politicians what wish to
learn-how. What-say Mr. Vergil, famous Roman
poeter, about them god January? He-say, ‘Get
there, January!’ which have been a politickal
motto every since.”</p>

<p>“Have that disgusting January got any temples
in America?” require Hon. Anazuma.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“In Pennsylvania State Capitol there is pagan
pictures of Hon. Mat Quay and other local gods,”
I dib deceptively. “I shall not be wonderful if
portrait of Hon. January are grafted among nearly
everything else in that famous art saloon.”</p>

<p>“When you are President how you stand on
publick ownership of R. Rs?” require Hon. Barb.</p>

<p>“About publick ownership I are safely insane,”
I report. “Publick should be allowed to own
R. R. gradually. With each Pullman ticket Hon.
Passenger might get a blue transfer which entitle
him to 1 share R. R. stock if he present it at office
of Sec. of Agriculture 2,000,000 years from date.”</p>

<p>“Would American people get such a ownership
then?” ask he.</p>

<p>“What say Wm. Jenny Bryan about publick
ownership?” I reject. “He-say, ‘Publick ownership
of R. Rs must take place in eventual time,’
Them 2,000,000 years from date will be a ‘eventual
time,’ won’t it not?”</p>

<p>“In 2,000,000 year what would American publick
own?” are question for Anazuma.</p>

<p>“At least they would own them blue transfer
slips,” I renig with deceptive expression of a
Campaign Contribution.</p>

<p class="tb">Late Sunday <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> Arthur Kickahajama give
to me for Campaign Contribution a live dog which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
is a Hon. Pup. It are a very infant mammal
with a emotional tail and cultivated by flees.
Arthur rescue them Dog while being kicked from
a wharf by a educated gentleman who was drunk.</p>

<p>“It are a vulgar variety,” I snip for objection
because I are nervous about expensive food for
such a dum friend.</p>

<p>“It may grow up to be refined,” say Arthur
carelessly.</p>

<p>“What breed of Dog are it?” is next fuss from
me.</p>

<p>“Not certainly sure,” say Arthur. “Hon.
Strunsky who are a sport say ‘It are a he-dog,’
so I suppose it are such a breed.”</p>

<p>I regard this Hon. Pup with thoughts. He
throw me a very doggy gaze &amp; thump banzai on
floor with his snubbed appendix. My heart
become soft-boiled with love. I can’t not turn a
dog away in such a hot weather when he are apt
to be bit by a rabbi &amp; get it. So I possess him
by chains and enjoy worry about his breed which
are full of spots with a bursted ear.</p>

<p>S. Wanda, Japanese Socialist, say he should
be named “Tariff” because he need revising immediately.
Cousin Nogi announce, “He should
be named ‘Injunction’ because he were kicked off
a platform.”</p>

<p>“I shall not call such names to a mere dog,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
I gratify. “Therefore I shall chrisen him
‘O-Fido’ what was name of a famous Japanese
grocer what live happy for 1,000 year and died
from being too joyful.”</p>

<p>So I got O-Fido in bedstead with me where
he practise barks at Hon. Rats all night till
Japanese persons sleeping in this house can not
do so &amp; report tearful complaints to Hon. Landlord
who is a malefactor &amp; say: “You are a
nusance besides 3-week remit with rent.” Moral
of this is: Be kind to them dum beasts &amp; you
will get paid off.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW AMERICAN ADVERTISEMENT DOES IT</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, July 28th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper who might
know list of peculiarities.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Sir</span>—Please to ask some of your
customers who read that dear paper to tell
one necessary reply to poor Japanese Boy who
is again in condition of not working. Please ask
them how best for cheap money I can advertise
myself as needing situation of employment at
wash-dishes, table-wait, being valet or teaching
American language to Japanese or German
foreigners. I put in the following itemized appeal
into San Francisco newspaper-press:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Wanted</span>—Japanese Schoolboy is earnest about something
to do, and can speeck Japanese or American while
doing so. Can make beds politely, cherish house-plants and
assist cow or horse of good family. I perform most difficult
duties when confined to kitchen and can persuade Pianola to
go when excited. Answer it immediately. Maybe that will
be too late—Response, Togo, this news.</p>

</div>

<p>That correspondence cost me price of $1.85
obtained by borrowing. I am depressed about
results and confused to think. This morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
I see that advertise in newspaper-press where I
put it. But sakes of life! how difficult to see it!
I look in Wanting Column of this journal-paper
and find such disgusting number of persons was
pleading for jobs and was crowding all over that
page saying so about it. Very few of these offered
to do such talented things like I did. And yet I
was No. 114 in that list of workers! It is very
difficult for pride of Japanese Boy to read about
himself in such small print.</p>

<p>Of suddenly I enjoy one serious brain-thought.
Advertising is one beautiful national custom
which Japanese Boy must learn before becoming
complete. It is habit of these U. S. persons to
print statements of their virtues and hand it
around. In Japan when spring of love-time come
along persons deliver little lily-pad plants to
doorstep and remind friends of their aliveness.
In these U. S. persons at approach of springtime
deliver advertisement-circular for same reason.
Hon. Dr. Smith, dentist, leave to doorstep of dear
friend following card:</p>

<p class="center">DO YOU ENJOY TOOTHACHE?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Smith Pulls Teeths From Experience</span></p>

<p class="center">GET THE HABIT!!!</p>

<p>Each gentleman indulging in art or business
do likesome to any extent. Gentlemen wishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
to succeed in poetry, plumbing, clergyman or
eye-wash medicine must put-in some kind of
holler about it.</p>

<p>Landscapes is good for these decorations.</p>

<p>In travelling through American scenery by
rail-car I can not interest my brain-thoughts in
birds &amp; flowers because of large conversation
which persons has painted all over nature. By
sweet runny-brook is sign-post of fierce red to
say, “Sizzo Table Water. It is Sufficient.” By
grandeur of top-mountain is reckless blue motto,
“Circulation of <i>Daily Bazoo</i> Is Making Climb
Up.” By lovely oat-patch is signature, “Mormon
Oats—They Chew Themselves.” Meadow
of grass is full with gigantic hop-frogs, aggrevated
bottles, magnificent lady-corsets, etc., which
eminent American sculptors has cut out with
saws. Nature is somewhere behind these, but
what is she doing? Maybe she is trying to grow.</p>

<p>Frequent professors say-so about American
Indians talking with sign-language. Is that it
what I seen?</p>

<p>Sidney Katsu, light-thinking Japanese of considerable
deceptiveness, say to me of recent date:</p>

<p>“Hon. Togo, you hear what-about has happen
to American battle-fleet?”</p>

<p>“Tell me to know,” I renig with excitement,
because I am Japanese Spy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>“So much is them war-boats painted of white
colour they will be used for advertisements when
approaching to China,” deliver this Katsu.</p>

<p>“Oh not to be possible!” I collapse, “what
advertisement will be decorated upon this patriotic
navy?”</p>

<p>“Following words will there be painted upon
each white-side boat,” commute Katsu and show
this card:</p>

<p class="center">THIS FLEET IS PAINTED WITH<br>
SNOWDRIFT ENAMEL PAINT<br>
<span class="smcap">Try It on Your Bath-tub</span>!!!</p>

<p>Shall I believe this calamity to American navy,
Mr. Editor? I am disgusted to suspect that
fly-off brain of Sidney Katsu. Some one has
reached him to tell lying talk, American custom.</p>

<p>It is sinful to legal laws of America for poets,
actoresses, politicians, burglary and other authors
to put-in advertisements about theirselves. So
it is difficulty for them. And yet they do it.
How so? By becoming so active that newspaper-print
is irrisistable to talk about it. Maybe
actoress lose jewel-clasp. Burglary take it. She
report as follows, “Oh my!”</p>

<p>“What is difficulty of health, Hon. Madam?”
require reporter gentleman who is there.</p>

<p>“I have losed it my jewel-clasp,” she defy.</p>

<p>“Thank you for knowledge,” personify this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
Hon. Reporter, “While you are speeching about,
tell me of your marriages, please, as well as of
other family disconnections.”</p>

<p>So loud report of one column duration appear
by next news-print. Maybe lady noveletter name
of Mrs. McGlinny come over to here from kingdom
of London with book by title “Three Months.”
She enjoy great quiet, thank you, for that length of
time. At finally “Mothers of Rebellion,” sweet-hearted
collection of ladies, decry, “Come and
speech before us at dine-table, please.”</p>

<p>“So pleasant to do,” digest this Hon. Mrs.
McGlinny. “I will speech of what happened in
them 3 months.”</p>

<p>“Oh, not to do!” abrupt them mothers. “We
do not permit such talk before husbands, please.”</p>

<p>“O considerably well!” dement Mrs. McGlinny,
striking piano with angry rage. Immediately
she make rapid transit to newspaper press. Some
talk is made with reporter and by following morning
the below headlines is to appear:</p>

<p class="center">SUCH HORRID BOOK!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Is “Three Months” Thus?</span></p>

<p class="center">IT IS; AND WE WILL GIVE PRIZES TO PERSON<br>
WHO READS IT LEAST</p>

<p>By next morning one thousand million copy
of this book is entirely exhausted and publisher
is despondent because so fatigued.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>From Boston I discover this communication
which cover ½ page of all-American newspaper:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">American citizens are you all-time
foolish? Hon. Abe Lincoln say you are

you! Then why you no buy stocks when I

soon? It done something. Did I not told
you amalgamation of copper would go to

<p>“<span class="smcap">I will speech one last word before saying
more. On afternoon of Feb. 22 keep
eye-watch on tick-tock of stock. If

<p>“<span class="smcap">I often tell you to think. That will be

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>This letter of correspondence is wrote by
memory. Perhaps it is wrong in places. I am
often wonderful about this Hon. Lawson man.
Is he running for President or merely for fun?
I ask to know.</p>

<p>So this American kingdom go rapidly with speed
because of steam of them advertising. American
gentleman enjoys great smartness inside of brain.
He say “No use of doing nothing for nobody if
nobody knows.” So type-setting, bill-stucking,
paint-drawing is done. Violets is permitted to
blush behind something in these U.S. They usually
does this blushing performance behind sign-board
saying “50c per bunch.” If Hon. Lawson, Hon.
Bryan, Hon. Kipling can not get jobs of employment
without some advertisement, how can Japanese
Boy do so? This question make me put in
that item of ideas to wanting-column of news.</p>

<p>Maybe it will be responded for. I am patient

Do not the great Maggie Carter, famous document
signed by King John, promus justice to all Brittish
subjecks not of Irish birth? Then why should
not America &amp; England enjoy some more family
splits? Why should not Adm. Thos. Lipton
bring regatta of war-boats into N. Y. bay &amp; seize
Y. M. C. A. Athletick Club as spoil of war while
America fleet are away shaking hands with
Australia?</p>

<p>I require no answer.</p>

<p>Them Olympus Games are a great event for
all Nationalities with excepting of Japanese
who is too civilized to enjoy such rude fights.
Such games is a considerable antique, for
they was invented at Battle of Marathon in a
previous <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> time. On them occasion a
Grecian boy run 27 mile to get away from
Hon. Persians &amp; was declare a champion by
Honduras, mayor of Athens.</p>

<p>This year it were decide to hold them Olympus
games at England, because English athletes can
win nearly everything when surrounded by Brittish
sentiment with sufficient Police near to see that all
rules is broken in a quiet &amp; orderly manner.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
Before Hon. Games was shot off Hon. Brittish
Athletick Committee set together for regulation of
events. Following were decide on by dignified
majority:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—English spirit of fair play must be visible
everywheres. Hon. Judge must be just to
all nations so long as England are ahead.</p>

<p>2—When England are losing Hon. Judge can
prevent this by ruling Americans out of race
for ungentlemanly conduct.</p>

<p>3—When American athlete are doing some up-jump
exercises British publick are warned
not to assist him by courteous remarks.
When compelled to speak they will be permitted
to say “Boo!” “Obtain a horse!”
or other wits of local flavour.</p>

<p>4—Since Hon. America has got a rawcuss voice
several disputes is bound to occur. So long
as such fights is Parlamentry &amp; corteous,
we do not objeck to it. Therefore we
snuggest following form of debate for all
disputes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Hon. American Committee</i>—Why you dishqualify
American run-man from 400-meater race?</p>

<p><i>Hon. Brittish Committee</i>—Because he are a fraud
of considerable professional trix. Also we
suspect he murder his mother in Omaha.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p><i>Hon. Am. Com.</i>—When you begin to suspect
all them horble crime against that young
man?</p>

<p><i>Hon. Brit. Com.</i>—When he got 50 yard ahead of
Brittish runner in race.</p>

<p><i>Hon. Am. Com.</i>—Will you permit-it for Hon.
America run-man to race it again &amp; show how
swiftly he can?</p>

<p><i>Hon. Brit. Com.</i>—Answer is, No!! Because he
could run several footsteps better than Hon.
Brittish run-man who would be beat. It are
slavish to be beat. Brittens seldom shall be
slaves.</p>

<p><i>Hon. Am. Com.</i>—If our runs is the swiftest should
they not have the most medals pinned all over
them?</p>

<p><i>Hon. Brit. Com.</i>—The race are not always for
the swiftest, Hon. Sir—not while Brittish
gods are ruling Olympus!</p>

</div>

<p>5—After above dyelog rioting, cat-calling &amp;
other sports shall be enjoyed &amp; American
athletes can go home or to any other blazes
they seen fit.</p>

</div>

<p>While attempting a slumber on couch of room
Uncle Nichi &amp; Cousin Nogi come in &amp; make a
joint debate with loud voices, which is very carelus
about my health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>“Hon. London <i>Times</i> decuss 400-meater-run
in an entirely Christian way,” corrode Uncle
Nichi who lacks dog-sense like O-Fido. “Them
great &amp; pompus news-print say: ‘It were a unfortunate
incident—therefore it are closed.’”</p>

<p>“London <i>Times</i> know-how to be nice to
Americans on all occasions,” explode Nogi. “She
speak of 400-meater run like she speak of Revolutional
War &amp; other uncleaned things.”</p>

<p>“America beat English in Revolutional War,”
rasp Uncle for discovery.</p>

<p>“Of sure she did,” obligate Nogi, “but on them
occasion she was the home team. If such a wars
had been fot on Brittish soil maybe Hon.
Geo. Washington would of been dishqualified
for crowding Gen. Corn Wallace off track.
Facts of history is often shaved by such close
razors.”</p>

<p>“Sport between such great nations should be
gentle &amp; just, whitewashed with truth &amp; free of
grafts,” commute Unc.</p>

<p>“So should Christianity, Socialism &amp; Hearst
Independence Leg,” otter Nogi, “but are they?”</p>

<p>“Them great kingdoms should meet in a
amature spirit,” I gap, because can’t sleep by
racket.</p>

<p>“What you mean by ‘amature spirit’?” require
Nichi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>“When Primrose Athletick Club &amp; Telegraf
Hill Wonders meet in vacated lot to
enjoy baseball, then amature spirit are
observed,” say Nogi. “Hon. Casey go to bat-stick.
Some ball-throws is indulged for vain
clubbing. ‘Outside, please!’ yall Hon. Empire.
‘Liar, please!’ jacklate Primrose Athleticks in
unicorn. Language is thrown everywheres followed
by bat-sticks, grand-stands, etc., which is
beaten upon skull until intermission by Hon.
Police.”</p>

<p>“And yet should civilized persons feel so bleed-thirsty
about innocent &amp; friendly sport?” ask
Uncle to know.</p>

<p>“More fraxures, murders, assault &amp; batters,
divorces &amp; strangles is caused by innocent &amp;
friendly sport than by jelousy, love, maniac,
drunk &amp; any other branch of crime excepting
of Life Insurance. Look on blotter of Hon.

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p>When Uncle Nichi hear-it all them record of
horble crimes he become seriously Japanese.</p>

<p>“O-so!” he-say, “Must there be a war between
America &amp; England because of a mere feet-race?”</p>

<p>“If a mere feet-race can’t start a war, nothing
can. Who can imagine them two great &amp; dignified
peoples making such hell-baloo over seal-fisheries
or boundery-line between U. S. &amp; Canada
or small trifle like annexation of Ireland? Did

<p>Mr. Editor, entire trouble with them Olympus
games was that American athletes was handicapped
by English sense of Fair Play which are a
famous &amp; sacred thing &amp; will stop at nothing
when it get a chance. English Fair Play have
always been a deliciously important fackter in her
Colonial Policy. It were that same holy fire what
give to America a Stamp Act &amp; Taxation without
Representations; send Lord Clive on famous
jewel-robberies among Moguls what was entirely
pagan &amp; needed doing; force hon. opium-smoke
down palate of Hon. China so she would sleep
better; and sley Mary, Queen of Scotch, with a
hatchet because she live in the suburbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>What-say renewed Irish Orator about England.
He-say, “O perfidious Albino!” I am sly about
repeating such mean curses.</p>

<p>Strength of Hon. England are this: she can lie
longer, steal stronger &amp; look more respectable
than any other ancient Nation now living.
America is filled with disgusting Grafts, but
Hon. England have got only a House of Lords
decorated with coated arms &amp; vested rights.
London are poplus with Life Insurance Presidents
disguised as Missionaries. If Jo-uncle
Cannon had a accent made in Oxford &amp; a suit
of clothing made in Hanover Square he would
not need to change his politicks before setting
in the House of Lords. I are very nervous
about England’s soul.</p>

<p>Cousin Nogi, who partly agree with me in some
things, say, “I are joyfully congratulated not to
be mixed up in such Olympus affairs.”</p>

<p>“English sense of Fair Play are a joke,” I scorch.</p>

<p>“Perhapsly that are why it are took so seriously
in England,” make-up Nogi.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—Year of America are divided into
2 sessions: Winter &amp; Summer. Winter are
devote to acquiring disease inside; Summer are
devote to getting rid of them outside. Winter are
dedicate to serious pursuit of money; Summer are
devote to fooly pursuit of rest. Both are good
ways to know and increase Hon. Death Rates.</p>

<p>Predatory gentlemans what are rich enough to

Man who break Interstate Commerce law a little

<p>Americans go for rest with energy of human

<p>“A rest,” he corrode for dying smiles.</p>

<p>“You have found it too suddenly,” I commute
with epitaph expressions. “Therefore you may
rest in fractions.”</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, to remain good-healthy it are nice
to choose some exercise what you will not be killed
by. Motor-car axidents, although a very wealthy
sport, are a too violent physical culture for Japanese
Boy who would prefer to be alive &amp; slightly
sick much rather than to be dead &amp; in splandid
muscular condition. Considerable Heroes of
antiques has did jiu jitsu to Tyrants and yet been
entirely ignorant of Hon. Spalding’s Feetball
Guide. But them things happened in very former
times.</p>

<p>Shortly ago I become nervous about high education
of brain. “I must see some scholars doing
it,” I narrate to myself; so for car-fare I go visit
one intelligent Red Colledge what are nearly
here. When I approach near to campuss I am
aware of excitable sing-song of loud mail voices
saying something together.</p>

<p>“So lofty!” I dib. “They are resighting passages
of Grecian poetry in chorus so they all will
get 100% mark for classick examination!”
I make excited breath &amp; hurry foots to where it
happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>There beholt! was all young youths of this Red
Colledge stooding together for wave of danger-signal
flags &amp; saying following rotation for voice-culture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hurrah! Hurrah!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Play glibly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And do more of!!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">O!!!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Such a bully for you!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>(Repeat this several times for imagination.)</p>

<p>And by opposite chairs was setting a Blue Colledge
with appropriate shade of wave-flag with
which they make wigwag signals to following
rotation for voice-culture:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sissy-boom!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">What is wrong with us?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By investigation we find</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We are considerably all right—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore Hurrah HURRAH!!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On smooth place between grandstands was
2 teams of red &amp; blue baseballers playing it with
batty acrobaticks. One youngful man containing
red sox was considerably idealized by Red Colledge
because he was a Hon. Pitch and could act deceptively
while shooting fastly to Hon. Catch. When
Hon. Bat would make swipe-stick knocks at Hon.
Ball what go by without injury, then entirely that
Red Colledge would scream up, “O Smith, Smith,
you are so good to do it!!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>When Hon. Blue Runner would attempt to slide
on knuckles &amp; Hon. Red Pitch would observe
him with deceptive throw, then such banzais from
Hon. Red Colledge what would hoola out loud,
“Hurrah some more for Hon. Smith who deserve
it!”</p>

<p>I stand by-next to one Hon. Professor what was
also shouting with gilt spectacles.</p>

<p>“Mr. Sir,” I commune, “why this Colledge
make such proud whoop-up for that Smith youth,
please?”</p>

<p>“Hon. Smith are most smartest man in Colledge,”
say Hon. Professor with surprise for
ignorance.</p>

<p>“Ah!” I collide. “So thankful to see such a
leader of thought! By what branches of brain do
he most exsel in these classick hallways of Mrs.
Minerva?”</p>

<p>“He are a hundred yard dasher of 9 seconds, he
are a pole-jump of 12 feet, for 2 years he play
short-stop on feetball game and can throw a spitting
baseball in circles around all batty athletes.”</p>

<p>“He must be a very high educated man,” I
combust; “I bet your bootware that Hon. Shakespeare
could not do nothing like that.”</p>

<p>“Hon. Shakespeare was neglected in childhood,”
say Prof. “So he never go to colledge to learn
how.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>“So sorry for that!” I ratify. “Do this Hon.
Smith have very muscular mind for study of
Grecian poetry?”</p>

<p>“Scarcely if seldom,” mitigate Hon. Prof.
“Faculty of this Colledge do not believe in making
bright mind of youth sad by too much read on
subjecks of solum &amp; trajick Greek poetries.”</p>

<p>“They should read Hon. Aristophanes,” I say-so,
“for he was considered a very comick Greek
poet.”</p>

<p>“Maybe-so he were,” dib them Prof. “But
I have been teacher of classick literature for 35
tiresome years, and never yet have I saw any
colledge boys tickling themselves to death with
jokes from that Hon. Aristophanes.”</p>

<p>I am entirely flabbed. So I go to Carnegie
Library of them Colledge to see by quiet look how
many of them student was improving inside of
skulls by books. And there what see? Three
Japanese students setting in bench for lonesome
company. One of them was studying “Antique
War Map of Battle of Marathon.” Other
was taking light chew from “Co-tangent Theory
about Circular Orbits,” and other one was trying
to translate works of James Whatcome Riley into
Japanese.</p>

<p>I sneak silently out with mollycuddle feelings of
instep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>Sydney Katsu say-so that game of Golluf are
called “sport of kings.” Therefore if any private
gentleman wishes to become a king or something
in America he must go to meadows and learn how-play
this peculiar knocking game. When Hon.
Rockefeller lernt it he became a Oil King &amp; still
continues to exercise.</p>

<p>Before Hon. Roosevelt decided to appoint Hon.
Taft to be King of America he-say him: “Hon.
Bill, what kind of a athlete are you, please?”</p>

<p>“I are a very distinguished trot,” narrate Wm.
“I have become noted by running from places
to places.”</p>

<p>“These U. S. won’t not stand no more fat
heroes,” say Hon. Roosevelt. “What possibly
good it do you to have newspaper print say ‘Hon.
Taft spend 24 hours daily at desk?’ Small or
less. But have war correspondent say ‘Hon.
Taft spend 24 hours daily tearing teeth out of
wild bulls’ and you will be called upon by 1,000
photographers &amp; Frederick Remington.”</p>

<p>Hon. Taft set silently eating fattening cigars.</p>

<p>“When you are training to be a king,” say Hon.
Theo, “you must exercise to develop considerable
chest.”</p>

<p>“I have a developed chest already,” snuggest
Hon. Taft, drawing his belt close around.</p>

<p>“Assuredly you have,” say Hon. President,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
“but you should wear it higher so that it would
show to better advantage.”</p>

<p>“How to begin to be a National Athlete?”
say Hon. Wm.</p>

<p>“I began by breaking horses,” say Hon. Theo.</p>

<p>“I can easily break the stoutest horse by setting
on him,” abrogate Hon. Taft.</p>

<p>“I am disgusted by such a set-pat policy,” say
ruler of nation. “If you can not take exercise you
can at least play Golluf.”</p>

<p>So Hon. Roosevelt loand Hon. Taft a big club
if he promise not to broke it &amp; he find a nice,
green link near Light House at Washington where
he practise Hon. Golluf Game. On door of Sec.
of War it are now a easy snap to find following
card:</p>

<p class="center">HON. WM. H. TAFT<br>
<span class="allsmcap">ARE ABSENT ON LINK TO PLAY GOLLUF GAME FROM 2 TO 4</span><br>

<p>Mr. Editor, what are most principally shocky
&amp; surprise to me about outside exercises enjoyed
by Americans is that they takes them in such a
light &amp; frivlus spirit of josher. Are game of
health-bring and deep breathing merely a funny
laugh-at thing? Answer is, No!!</p>

<p>It sadden my pulse to see American family by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
good elderly summertime pack trunk to go shore-side.
Why they sing &amp; whistle comick song
about “I am timid to return home in darkness”?
Why so happy &amp; frolick for as they are gone down
to train? Do they not know that they are sujurning
away for benefit of kidney, liver &amp; lung, which
is hyjean &amp; therefore kind of sacred because it
can do a great deal of harm to all human races?
By border of ocean they go to some light hotel &amp;
dip slightly in tidy serf of sea, they lole upon sand
in delighted clothing, they puff cigarette, they
drink intoxicated ginriksha. By moontime they
practise whatever flirting is necessary—no
thoughts of their scientifick insides.</p>

<p>Ah, vacation should be a more solum &amp; useful
improvement! Japanese athlete would arise more
sadder &amp; stern by 6 of clocktime in morning to
do 986 dips with backbone for benefit of interior
digestion. He would measure self by Bertillon
system by each hourly prompt. Then he would
feel strong &amp; well, or else he wouldn’t. Vacation
are nothing to laugh at as if it was a jokes.</p>

<p class="tb">But Cousin Nogi are got so sinical he make Sneer-face
at everything including sacred subjecks &amp;
Tariff. Last night we go hear Prof. Matsuki,
Japanese hyjean, lecture-talk to Asiatick
Y. M. C. A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>“Intellectual gymnasiums, together with nurshing
food,” say Hon. Matsuki, “have increased
stature of Japanese nation 6 inches in last 10
years.”</p>

<p>Cousin Nogi deliver me one mean pinch by leg-joint.</p>

<p>“I shall give you a hit unless stop!” I dib for
pain.</p>

<p>“Listen to them lecture what he say-it!” fatigue
Nogi. “He-say each Japanese by exercises &amp;
feed has grew 6 inches in 10 year-time. At them
rate they will all be 5 ft. 10 inches by 1918.”</p>

<p>“That are a nice patriotick average for me,”
I surround.</p>

<p>“By keeping on with eat &amp; gymnastus they will
all be 6 ft. 10 inches in 1938. What, then, would
keep all Japanese from being 8 ft. 10 inches lofty
in year 1978?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but laziness,” I repose for answer.</p>

<p>“The Japanese is aptly determined,” decry
Nogi, showing satire by nose. “If they use considerable
Christian Science about growing up
could they not become physical sky-scrapes in
time?”</p>

<p>“They might, but could they?” is answer for
me.</p>

<p>“And what if they attained such a lofty?”
locate Nogi with skeptick look from Missouri,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
“would they be more smart if? Physical culture
do not make persons able to lecture on works
of Browning and Chiropodes. Hon. James Jeffries
are a very physical cultured man, yet he can
only lick one person at a time. Hon. Napoleon,
what was a brief man with a circular stummick,
could combatter 10,000 talented Germans by
twist of his thumbs.”</p>

<p>“Yet Hon. Napoleon were finally a sick failure,”
I announce for sighs.</p>

<p>“Of surely he were not!” dib that heated Nogi.
“If he were a failure how he got his nephew that
high job in Roosevelt Cabinet?”</p>

<p>I am confused to answer.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same, I am</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, August 26th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York newspaper which shoots out
Truth like a soda fountain &amp; serve it with
very tasty flavours to all-kind of humans.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I am bed-riding now, thank you,
for illness of head. So sorry I go Fresno last
week to seek-it where work was to be got among
Hon. Grapes, but not for me. The weather had a
temperament of 98° in shadow &amp; pretty soonly I
am discovered enjoying a sunstrike by dusty road.
“Poor Japanese Boy!” collapse kind Mr. Jackson,
who is a sweet philanthropy; so he ship me
backwards to this dear San Francisco and donate
me $10 weekly so long as I am sick.</p>

<p>On such a salary I shall be liesurely about getting
well.</p>

<p class="tb">So here I are, Mr. Editor, once more again at
Patriots of Japan Board &amp; Lodging, where I
receive all Japanese and American friends who will
be polite guests &amp; please not bring no more flours
because my hon. bedroom become stuffy with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
such fragral smells. Candy &amp; light sandwitches,
howeverly, will be welcome day &amp; night.</p>

<p>Cousin Nogi, Arthur Kickahajama, Uncle Nichi,
Sydney Katsu Jr., Little Annie Anazuma &amp; Frank
the Japanned Bootpolish make walk-in to my
room this morning to be a Tennis Cabinet for me.
They bring golden thoughts, but nothing more
expensive.</p>

<p>“In Idaho &amp; Colorado where ladies is compelled
to smoke cigarettes and act manly on
election days,” say Cousin Nogi, “there Hon.
Frank H. Hitchcock will get elected by a unamerous
majority because of his beautiful eyes and
hair.”</p>

<p>“He will be very popular in high schools,
Vassars, etc., because of his sweet expression,”
olicute little Annie.</p>

<p>“Will such a expressions make him popular
among campaign contributions?” contribute
Japanned Frank with steam-roller sniff.</p>

<p>My Hon. Friends then begin making talk all
over my very sick bed with awful feverish debats
until I groan from hot brows, because I got a sun-strike.
Political conversation next turn to all-kinds
tropickal subjecks. Cousin Nogi mention
Hon. Revolution in Honaduras; Japanned Frank
say-so that Hon. Cuba can’t never escape from
Hon. Taft when he got it; Uncle Nichi enquire to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
know if Rep Party will continue to be useless about
Philippine tobacco; and Little Annie Anazuma
tell of paper-news she read about hon. yellow
fever enjoyed by Hon. Dirt Digs of Panama Canal.</p>

<p>I put hand to my boiled skull &amp; collapse with
gasps.</p>

<p>“You are a loud noise,” I liquidate. “When
you come to bedstead of a sunstruck person, why
you all-time talk about politicks what are happening
all over Hon. Equator?”</p>

<p>“Would some breezy topick of conversations be
more pleasant for such a sun-strike?” enquire
Uncle Nichi with farm-yard voice.</p>

<p>“Iced thoughts would be very nice for brain,”
I dib with fan.</p>

<p>Then up say Arthur Kickahajama, missionary
boy who will be a heathen 2 weeks more before
vacation is over,</p>

<p>“I have got just such a cold topicks,” he-say.
“Hon. Adm. Peary, intemperate explorer on cold-weather
boat <i>Roosevelt</i>, have started for Swartzburger,
Sweden, in hopes that he will discovery an
entirely iced Pole before it melts.”</p>

<p>“Thank you so much, Arthur Kickahajama,”
I sigh-up for relief, “already I feel some pleasant
chills in my vertebral.”</p>

<p>“In his kitty of supplies,” say Arthur, “Hon.
Peary have took 750 blankets of red flannel complexion,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
100 grizzly-skin pajamas, 60 Tiny Wonder
gas-heaters, 7 tons axle-greeze to use as butter
when starving &amp; 20 doggy-sleys with limousine
tops to keep off cold.”</p>

<p>“What are he going to North Pole for if he desire
to keep off cold?” I enquire with sun-stroke gasps.</p>

<p>“I am confused about it,” say Arthur. “Hon.
Peary perform a interview for N. Y. <i>Journals</i>
before depart. ‘Are you afraid of a freeze?’
Hon. Reporter ask to know. ‘No, I are not,’ he
reply for pride.”</p>

<p>“All Arctick explorers is entirely fearless about
freezing in July,” report little Annie Anazuma,
who are a bright for her nine-year age.</p>

<p>“If a good detective should discover this Pole
what would he discover?” require Uncle Nichi,
who is becoming educated in American telephones.</p>

<p>“He would discover considerable bad weather,”
abrogate Nogi.</p>

<p>“Should a person go through such a pearil &amp;
danger to discover bad weather?” say Uncle who
can enquire if nothing else.</p>

<p>“It are the pearil &amp; danger what makes all them
furry gentlemans so anxious to get it,” say Nogi.
“If Hon. North Pole was in our back yard who
would care to have it?”</p>

<p>“I should like some chunks for headache,”
I negligè with pained eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Polar discovery are a nice sport for Investigators,”
devote Frank.</p>

<p>“What would they investigate at North Pole?”
require Nogi for scorn. “Is there some Grafts at
North Pole? Have it got a Saloon Evil like
Chicago, or a Labour Trouble like Idaho, or a
Railroad Problemb like Illinois, or some Favourite
Sons like Ohio, or a Musical Mayor like San
Francisco, or some Senate Undesirables like Washington?
If Hon. Pole ain’t got no Hon. Shames
like them I mention it should be let alone. If it
<i>have</i> got such a Grafts they must be nicely packed
in ice where they will keep forever unless disturbed.
Why should a refined N. Y. gentleman travel all-way
to Latitude 0 for find some cold-storage graft
when he can get it entire year round in
Philadelphia?”</p>

<p>“We ask to know!” collapse my Japanese
Friends in unicorn &amp; leave me alonesome with
my sick medicines.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, as I continue enjoying sickness I
got time to think about important topicks in an
entirely fooly way. I think about all them
American &amp; English gentlemans what has seeked
North Pole because they was not tame enough to
enjoy game of golluf and bridge-card. How much
more jollifying to go straggling for deathsome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
effort over dreer waists of ice with full heart and
empty stummick—how much more pleasant this
are than continually gollufing over the links with
a retired cloak manufacturer what can’t talk
about nothing else besides roomatism &amp; Marie
Corelli! When Hon. Arctick Explorer think of
some persons he have left behind his awful solitude
become entirely cozy.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, what nationality of human races has
not enjoyed hunting for Poles? Irish mans,
Americans, Danes, Swedishes, all make rapid vi
with each other for this sport. Hon. Russian police
is also fond of hunting Poles, but them is
usually of an entirely Jewish variety. Hon.
Duke de Bruzzi were unable, thank you, to observe
the Hon. Pole to discover it; but he recently discover
America with a very matrimonial expression.
Only human nationalities which does not care
about dashes to North Pole is Hon. Niggers which
is too lazy and Hon. Japanese which has got too
much sense.</p>

<p>Hon. Walter Wellman of Chicago discover Hon.
Pole in a airship. Hon. Magazines, Newspaper
press, etc., all get delicious accounts about Hon.
Wellman’s discovery long-time before it happen,
which was fortunate because it never did. Great
day of discovery arrive. “Are you ready, Hon.
Wellman?” require Hon. Photographer with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
Chicago accent. “Of sure I are!” explode Hon.
Wellman, who was without a daunt. “Then cut-it
the string!” say-all, and Hon. Airship arise to
duzzy hight of 18 feet where Hon. Wellman could
see distinctly maglificant penorama of Arctick
scenery with nice fotos of Alice Boreas all lit up,
which he send to Chicago newsoffice with report,
“I am sure Hon. North Pole are still over there.”
Then his airship descend down with a bursted
stummick.</p>

<p>Since then Hon. Wellman have turned from
Baloons to Bryan. He-say for recent newspaper
article: “Hon. Bryan will of sure get to White
House by a short cut.” If Hon. Bryan start
to White House by Hon. Wellman windship he
might get there, but would he?</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I have following poetick rapture

<p>Mr. Editor, I am aware why Hon. Peary boat
are called the <i>Roosevelt</i>. It are because it are a
hot thing in a cold climbate—also because it are
a champion ice-burster. (At least smile at this,
please, because it would sound delicious in
Japanese.)</p>

<div class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus15" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus15.jpg" alt="">
  <p class="caption">“They should not make groups around with scissors to cut
away souvenirs from him”</p>
</div>

<p>Seriously thinking it, I shall not prevent that
Hon. Peary from going to North Pole as oftenly
as whimsical; and yet I peev with complaint
because he do it on so small scales. He are a
small dealer in Poles, therefore he should be
crowded to wall by all rules of Interstate Commerce.
Would it not be more better for civilization
if Arctick Circle was organized into exploration
Trust with $20,000,000 capital and several
Senators? You bet your bootware such a Trust
would get to Pole &amp; build trolley to there in less
time than it take to pass a Forest Reserve Bill.
I am surprised that such a Trust has not thought
of this already, for what-say Hon. Kipling? He-say:
“Is seldom a law of man or God found North
of 23.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span></p>

<p>Such a climbate would be awfully ideel for
a Trust.</p>

<p>Yet I am suspicious. If Hon. Wall Street are
not interested in North Pole there must be deliciously
little laying loose around there to steal.</p>

<p>For final thought, Hon. Sir, I suspect that considerable
salt-drip of tears is waisted on them cool
heroes of far North. Mrs. Lusy Macdonald,
tender &amp; fat angel, say: “Poor mans, not to have
fresh asparagus for months in &amp; out!”</p>

<p>“Truly so,” I navigate, “but if they have no
fresh asparagus, they also has no mosquitos.”</p>

<p>“Togo, should you like to be a Arctick Explorer
you talk like?” she ask it.</p>

<p>“I should like to be ½ a Arctick Explorer,” I
struggle. “If I was permitted to do so I should
enjoy to be Hon. Peary during June, July, August
&amp; Sept. During Fall &amp; Winter months I should
be pleased to spread gospels among better warmed
cannibels of South Seas.”</p>

<p>“Both are noble trades for a hero,” say-she for
kind sentiment.</p>

<p>“It are pleasant to be useless during vacations,”
I dib.</p>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Sept. 1st.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor of New York Newspaper which must be
very marriageable person, if he has not already
attended his own.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Mr.</span>—Frank the Japanned Bootpolish,
who is a mental Socialist, say me this statistick
for peevish argument:</p>

<p>“Twenty-five thousand pairs of people is married
together by each day in these U. S.”</p>

<p>“Such delicious number of happiness!” I commit,
pointing to Utah on map.</p>

<p>“Of them 25,000 wedding ceremonies,” derange
Frank with Harvard expression, “at leastly 23,000
is International Marriages, including, by police-record,
following races: Huns, Finns, Siberians,
Liberians, Polaks, Mollusks, Mazourkas, Dons,
Otts, and Pennsylvanians.”</p>

<p>“Them races is told apart by washing them,”
I deride for conversation.</p>

<p>“Of them 23,000 assorted foreigns getting
married together by each day, maybe there is a
few number with something queer about them;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
maybe 100 of them has clubbed feets, 50 of them is
double-jointed dwarfs, 10 of them has two heads
apiece, 6 of them is Siamese twins, and 1 or 2 of
them is a Duke or something.”</p>

<p>“Do newspaper-press mention with loud excitement
the marriage of all them Hon. Freaks?” I
ask for knowledge.</p>

<p>“Seldom if any,” say Frank the Japanned
Bootpolish. “What say Hon. Shakespeare about
International Marriages? He-say, ‘When Princes
wed there is such big show that other Hon. Freaks
must crawl out under tent.’”</p>

<p>“Do you not say jokey-talk when you mention
that Hon. Prince among other Hon. Freaks?” I
inquire to know.</p>

<p>“Ah no!” rejoy that Frank. “Is not one Hon.
Prince some Freak? Yes, surely so! Is not one
baby born with crown on top of skull as curio to
see as one baby born with six ears? Boots can be
bet on it!”</p>

<p>“Too sad,” I collapse with tear-drop of eye.
“When one Hon. Prince come to this U. S. persons
should be more politeness. They should not
make groups around him with scissors to
cut away souveners from him. They should
not lift off his Hon. Derby to take peeps at
his Hon. Crown. Maybe he is sensitive about his
deformity!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“Hon. Princes is not entirely like other common
Freaks,” debate Hon. Frank.</p>

<p>“With what for difference?” I reject.</p>

<p>“Common Freaks is supported by Museums
which do very well. Hon. Princes is supported
by Tradition which often forget to pay salary.
Hence appropriations must be voted in U. S. Senate
for International Marriages.”</p>

<p>My cousin Nogi, which hear them words we
spoke in Japanese syllables, come up and say,</p>

<p>“If Hon. Senator Pelkins permit Hon. Duke
de Buzzi to marry his family, will this not be
considered unpatriotick act to do? Will not Hon.
Senator occupy anonamous position in U. S.
Senate?” This from Nogi.</p>

<p>“I am reminded of fudge!” I relapse with expression
of iced aristocrat. “He will occupy elsewhere
position!”</p>

<p>“What committee in U. S. Senate could endure
such Hon. Senator when so related to pompous
crown of Italy?” require Japanned Frank.</p>

<p>“Committee on Foreign Relations would be very
nice seat for such Senator,” I commute with
decorated appearance from eyebrow.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, I am a shock &amp; grief to see attitudes
of this America to them Nobilities caming here in
seek for employment. Why for is such high-tariff<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
policy in this free kingdom on them European
manufactured goods like automobiles, barons and
carved sculptors? America are entirely anxious
to become civilized—yet how can she get it without
some of them things made in Germany for
small price? In France any mechanical working-girl
can afford to buy one small Baron on easy
installment plan. In Italy they are served as
waiters with meals. Americans may collect them
in all countries of Europe, but in Custom House
of U. S. they are insulted and treated like works
of art, because Hon. Jo-uncle Cannon are so
chivalrous about Hon. Sugar &amp; Tobacco.</p>

<p>But ah! I know, Mr. Editor. Hashimura Togo
are on to some sure wisdom about why them Hon.
Nobles is so rare to get in this America when
delicious to have! Hon. Trusts do it!! It are
one Combination in Restraint of Trade. Day-by-year
Hon. Small Dealer is crowdy to wall.
How often do Dukes come to America with purpose
of marrying some Common People? Never
if seldom—except when them Common People
is rich as they are common. Who get first pick-out
of the Sizzyeni and De Chagrin families when they
arrive to Custom House? Do Hon. Employment
Bureaus? Do Plumbers &amp; Joiners Union?
Do Beneficial Order of Elks?</p>

<p>Reply is, NO! Who do, then? For answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
write to Hon. La Folette who will send, by
stamp, list of persons who done it, including
97 varieties of wealth.</p>

<p class="tb">Hon. Henry Watterson, who is official thinker
for Kentucky, say-so that this kingdom is deliciously
disgusted about Princes because it are
entirely Democratick by vote. Foreign titles give
especial loathing to desperate patriots like Hon.
Hearst, who say that all Dukes ought to be shot; so
he do so, thank you, with foto camera.</p>

<p>During the wedding season in America it are
nice trick for Japanese Schoolboy to set in sofa of
very gilt hotel and watch something. Pretty
soonly it arrive. It is one quiet gentleman of grey
finish who make sneak-walk in at tradesman
entrance of hotel. He is scarcely to be noticeable
except for fact that he wear blue goggles &amp; green
beard to appear natural. As he approach to desk
of Hon. Clerk there is nervous creaking of furniture
where Hon. Reporters is hidden in.</p>

<p>“Name, please, to register it!” say Hon. Clerk
with pen.</p>

<p>“John Smith of Nebraska,” remit them stranger
with Kansas accent.</p>

<p>“You are a ugly word!” renig that Clerk with
teeth. “Nobody in Nebraska have such queer
name like John Smith.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>(Impatient noises heard from kodaks behind
furniture.)</p>

<p>“On what business are you here on?” relapse
Hon. Clerk.</p>

<p>“I ain’t not here on no business. I are——”</p>

<p>“You <i>are</i>,” abjurgate Clerk, “then you admit
it!”</p>

<p>“He admit it!!” cry-out 17 Reporters &amp; 9
Photographers arising from furniture.</p>

<p>“Which do I admit?” desire Hon. Stranger
beginning to make tears.</p>

<p>“You are the Prince de Chagrin!” collapse all
in unicorn.</p>

<p>“Discovery!” cry that unhappy Prince, fainting
away into bar-room. All kodaks explode
simultaneously.</p>

<p>With immediate quickness that Hotel become
one International Affair. Telegraf editors of all
prominent newspresses set desks in lobby to be
near it; hallway in front of bedroom where Hon.
Prince is awake, is full with interviewers, biographers,
historians, popular novelists, muck-rakers,
scratch-artists, paint-artists, photographers
&amp; engravers.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly <i>Evening Bagpipe</i> come out.

<p>By lamplight yesterday I attend one Hon.
Lecture at Socialist Hall.</p>

<p>“Time will came, and soonly,” say Hon. Lecture
“when working man of America will got everything
he want.”</p>

<p>“Will he got a foreign title for self &amp; family?”
I enquire with voice.</p>

<p>For them question I was rejected for being a
Japanese Spy.</p>

<p>And yet it was a fairful question to reply. If
Hon. Workman deserve to own the Trusts he also
deserve to own them Dukes &amp; Princes what Hon.
Trusts is working seriously to make corner for.
If Hon. Farmer of rural populus can have 1 automobile
and his Hon. Wife 1 Pianola, can not his
Hon. Daughter set on porch with some Italian
Nobility by summer evening? Can not Petaluma
<i>Clarion</i> appear each weekly with following
gossip of neighbouring live-stock:</p>

<p>“Bill Brown’s daughter, Countess Rockheimer
&amp; husband, made visit to the farm this week.
Welcome, strangers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“Si Perkins, Marquis of Perkins Corners, was
out plowing the North Acre on Saturday. His
Lordship is a very fine hustle.</p>

<p>“There is one new Duke in the Snodgrass
family. It’s a boy this time.</p>

<p>“Senator Elkhorn of Coalopolis are absent from
town on trip to St. Petersburg for visit his son-in-law
the Czar of Russia. Town looks pretty dead
without the genial Senator!”</p>

<p>No, Mr. Editor, trouble with this country is not
too many Dukes, but too less of them. If Americans
seen a Duke in every cigar-store they would
not name cigars after him. This is also found
amongst lower species. Insects is arranged carefully
in glass boxes and named after difficult
Latin poets as long as they are scarce and sly
about being coaxed by collectors. But when them
same Hon. Insects is discovered in colonies leading
simple life among potato plants they are generally
regarded to be Bugs. Thus I transfer it from
Japanese poetry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">If Grasshop Bugs was merely scarce to see</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And human persons was not used to its</div>

    <div class="verse indent4">Admiring of his limbs the way they fits.</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But Grasshop Bugs has got around so thick</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">That persons sweep them up in pans and pails,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And Poets, while them lovelus Grasshops kick,</div>

<p>I am given to be understood that Hon. King
Manuel of Portugal are looking for young lady
willing to be queen. Them news are causing very
dangerous heart-throb in family circle of U. S.
Senate.</p>

<p>S. P.—One banzai thought! Several months
pass-by ago one imperious Japanese Prince make
visit to America. Since he return to Japan there
has not been least slightest rumor of engagement
to him of Miss Vanderhooley of Newport. How
he escape from? This is one other evidence of
superior Japanese stratagem. I have feeling of

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Sept. 11th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper which make
very tough projectile for mind to chew.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Mr. Sir</span>—At Asiatick Delight Japanese
Employment Bureau where I am found mostly always
pleading for jobs with price $2, kindness loan
of Cousin Nogi, I am a stand-up in line yesterday
with other 43 Japanese Schoolboys which was also
nervus about it. S. Muto, Prop. of this Hon.
Bureau, see me with smile of riticule, because
he do.</p>

<p>“Togo you are residing here so oftenly you might
bring trunk and sleep. Why so jobless all time?
When I give you delicious something to do it, you
are back by return carfare for more.”</p>

<p>“Your jobs is all perishable, Hon. Muto,” I
exaggerate. “They will not keep in such climate.”</p>

<p>“You are also unkept,” decompose this Muto.
“You are a wrong Japanese to speek such
slamber about my jobs. You are a Servant
Problemb!”</p>

<p>At such American insult I feel Samurai instinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
with wrists. My interior soul make kicking performance
of jiu jitsu—but outside my moustache
I am a very smiling embassy like Hon. Baron
Takahira.</p>

<p>“I am so delight to hear!” I renig for sarcastick.
“I am aware of being a Yellow Peril—to be also a
Servant Problemb are considerable distinguish.
I am pretty pride about myself to be so much
altogether.”</p>

<p>“Why so you no stick to one job of work
and thusly gain experience by?” he denounce.</p>

<p>“Because-so,” I report. “Thank you, I can
gain considerable plenty experience by losing jobs.
I know because I do.”</p>

<p>“It are person like you that make Servant Problemb
in this kingdom,” collapse Hon. Muto with
peev.</p>

<p>“If I are such fine Servant Problemb,” I say
with voice, “why you no get me one job doing it?
Maybe some sweet-hearted American wish to
hire such a Problemb for $3 a week &amp; board it.
So I shall willingly go there with valise.”</p>

<p>“Have you got some good references of recommend
to show you could hold situation of Servant
Problemb elsewheres?” he say it.</p>

<p>“Of sure I have!” I degrade, so I took from my
inward vest following recommend of my intelligence
which I wrote myself:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—Mrs. C. W. O’Brien, honourable lady, where
I do table-wait &amp; terrible ordeel from fresh
American gentleman who say “Jap boy!”
with voice so I am very sorry when hot soup
drown him at collar &amp; I am next irritate to
race-riot with Whang So, China boy of dogly
face &amp; terminate there by hanging him by the
tail of his head to hon. doorknob. Good-bye,
Mrs. C. W. O’Brien! Time there was 3 week.</p>

<p>2—Hon. Miss Maizie Jone, young lady of considerable
antiquity &amp; large average weight,
promise pay me 10c hr. teach her bisickle
ride. I teach her gently by up-hill; but by
down-hill teaching become deliciously rapid
because of nervousness enjoyed by hon.
machinery. Japanese Boy is earnest to stop
it &amp; can not do until Baker Wagon ensue &amp;
leave Hon. Maizie broken among machinery.
I am Hospital Corps for help; but Hon.
Maizie become loudly thankless. Time there
was ½ hr &amp; no pay.</p>

<p>3—Board House of Mrs. Van Horn. There I
am guaranteed for experienced window-wash.
This is high task of scrubbing and I am
serious about it until suds-bucket overspill
3 stories to top of Episcopal Clergyman who
notice it. Hashimura Togo depart with fire-alarm.
Time there was 2 days, 15 minite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>4—Golden West Garage where I am manicure
for automobiles. “Are you acquainted to
do?” say Hon. Boss. “O gladly!” I bereft.
I try, but Hon. Gasolene object by explosion.
I do not care for this place. Time there
was 6 minites.</p>

<p>5—I am nurse-maiden for delighted home of
Duglas Willkins, Sausalito. I am request
to perambulate Hon. Godfrey, which is a
baby, out near some fresh air which he enjoy
breathing it. There I meet Wanda, Japanese
socialist, who discourse with me about
Private Ownership. While this important
talk is doing Hon. Baby get himself detached
from buggy-ride by one method or another.
I am conversing too much to notice this until
Hon. Mrs. Willkins approach to say with
hysterick, “Where is them Baby?” I should
like to answer. By search for it I discover
Hon. Baby aslumbering amongst huckledock
bush by road. She do not miss me at
departure. Time there was 3 days.</p>

</div>

<p>Hon. Sago Sadoyama, who is a professor of
American magazine-reading, was found at them
Employment Bureau looking for it also. While
awaiting for jobs we was delighted to have a
discuss. He say upwards of this:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>“I read in populus magazine for 10c one article
of title ‘Why Do Servants Leave Good Homes
When They Are Fired?’ I ask to know.”</p>

<p>“Answer to this is, Because,” I snuggle.</p>

<p>“Ah no!” say this Sago. “It are because
Declamation of Independence make them quit it.”</p>

<p>“How thus?” I delay.</p>

<p>“Because so,” say Sago. “Them Declamation
pronounce ‘All persons is crated free &amp; equal.’
That are nice maxim for school-houses, city halls,
grocery stores &amp; other patriotick edifices; but it
ain’t no good maxim for put over kitchen stove.
Each Household Lady what require to keep Hon.
Cook in kitchen must keep pretty silent about
Hon. Declamation of Independence, or Hon.
Cook might get suspicious that there is one.</p>

<p>“Suppose that Hon. Cook should see such a
Declamation while she was setting down to skin
hon. potatoes for lunching. While there she hear
Hon. Mrs. from parlour-room play tune of
‘Jolly Widow’ in key of piano. Of suddenly
Hon. Cook drop pair-knife with immediate brain-thought.</p>

<p>“‘Sake of!’ she decry. ‘If all persons is crated
free &amp; equal, why to skin potatoe? No person
what is free &amp; equal ever skin a potatoe. Therefore
not.’</p>

<p>“Silence from kitchen, then. Pretty soonly it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
are 1.30 of clock-time and Hon. Mr. Phillup retire
home from paint-works enjoying faintness.</p>

<p>“‘Hon. Mrs.’ he say-so to female wife, ‘where
is them lunch to eat it?’</p>

<p>“‘I will seen about,’ say Hon. Mrs. from piano
play. So she go kitchen expressing angry rage by
feet. There she find Hon. Cook wearing Jolly
Widow headware &amp; setting on valise meaning
good-bye.</p>

<p>“‘Bertha, kindly please, where is them lunch
to cook it?’ she deserve.</p>

<p>“‘Can not do, thank you,’ deliver that Hon.
Cook. ‘I are crated free &amp; equal. Also dam gas-range
enjoy large leak. Therefore I am delight
to tell you farewell because I am a decent average
girl.’</p>

<p>“That Bertha then depart from kitchen taking
part of it with her,” say Sago.</p>

<p>“Servant ladies what is too free &amp; equal is
found at liberty nearly all-time,” I rebate with
Asiatick salute.</p>

<p class="tb">One wise Professor which is mistaken say
“Trouble of these United State is that servants is
no good.” Such childhood to say! Trouble of
these United State is that servants is <i>too</i> good.
Most of them is too good to work except when
drove to by hungry symptoms of esophagus.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
Cooking lady are too good for sweep; sweeping
lady are too good for window-wash; window-wash
lady are too good for scrub; and scrubbing
lady are too good for anything. Frequently at
least some Hon. Employer when he hire Hon.
Servant forget how good them person is. Then
he must be snub.</p>

<p>“Are you a drunkard by habit?” enquire Hon.
Employer.</p>

<p>“I are,” relapse Hon. Servant. “Are you?”</p>

<p>“Are you careful of frugality, industrious, steady
moral, nice sleep-hours, early-rise man?” require
that Employer for nervus shock.</p>

<p>“I are not,” reply them Servant. “Are you?”</p>

<p>Hon. Employer now enjoy transom of angry
rage.</p>

<p>“You must be unfitted for any good job of work
to do it!” he corrode.</p>

<p>“Of sure I are,” flotate that Hon. Servant.
“How nicely you are guessing things!”</p>

<p>Hon. Employer stand gast for fluttering brain.</p>

<p>“You know who I are?” require Hon. Servant.</p>

<p>“I am aware at last,” say Employer. “You are
Upton Sincere the Boy Noveller attempting to give
me write-down for famous novel ‘The Meatropolis,’
which will describe my disgusting wealth.
You are fired in advance,” say Hon. Employer
escaping to hide self under bed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>In Japan, China, Corea &amp; other happy islands
where persons has sense enough to be entirely
Heathens, Servant Problembs is not there because
it is absent, thank you. There, when Hon. Servant
are awaiting on you, you are aware of it.
Tea is served by crolling on seat of stummick &amp;
bumping with forehead to announce it are ready.
If Japanese Servant require to cease job he are
legally require to ask Hon. Employer. If Hon.
Employer give his consent, Hon. Servant are legally
require to do hari-kiri with dull knife to show
how grateful he feel.</p>

<p>This custom make Japanese Servant bashful
about asking to quit.</p>

<p>Servants is exceptional to most golden rule, I
am at liberty to suppose. Are it not glory-bird feel
to be Independent? Ain’t not them Independence
a grand motion for hearts what makes hero
go fife-drumming to blaze of fireworks &amp; sley
something or be dead about it? Hon. Vergil say
in Latin class, “How nice it is to die for your
Country!” And yet so, what American of intelligence
would care to employ one Hero to do servanting
around house? Would it be pleasant to
have one Cook what is fond of sleying something
to fife-drum music? Answer is, No!! If Hon.
Butler absorb gin-wine &amp; march through dining-room
with purpose to die for his Country he are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
immediately discouraged by remark, “Hush!
Baby is asleep.”</p>

<p>When a patriot are Independent he are called
“glorious.”</p>

<p>When a Servant are Independent he are called
“undependable.”</p>

<p>Here is some tuneless poetry about a domesticated
cook:</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Sept. 24th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper who I include
to list of wireless friends.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>—One thousands of year previous
to now time-date what was heard in America
from both ends? Howeling of savages who enjoyed
it. What is heard by to-day time? Considerable
more howeling, thank you; but it is being did over
Columbus, Mr. Editor, Hon. New York <i>Journal</i>
telephone. Before discovery of Manhattan by
was embarrassed for awfully little quantities of
scientifick interest to print. By present time
of date Hon. Reporter for them <i>Journal</i> are
heartsick to keep 100 years ahead of feetsteps of
Science for Sunday edition. Such is vast straddel
of Modern Education. If all them Scientifick
Fact I read about is truthful, then this world of
which we live are getting along too fastly to be
good-healthy. If it keep on going at thus rate
some day Chicago will explode &amp; be off map.</p>

<p>Science, Mr. Editor, am a very benefital thing
when took in moderate doses. It keep Professors<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
from going to Congress, it make murder-by-machinery
very pleasant and give Naval Construction
Board chanst to insult itself. Yet do Science
of such quantity compel persons to be more happier
in sweetheart surroundings of home-life?
Simple candlelight of our New English ansisters
beampt on happy glow-faces of dear family
gathered at table-cloth to eat local bean off cob.
Do Newport Father &amp; Mother of present to-day
felt more entranced setting below 100 horsepower
chandelier awaiting, O so vainly, for their female
daughter to elope with some Duke of foreign
arrival? To disappointed heart, Mr. Editor,
Science can’t do nothing despite of electrick fans,
all-night elevator and 5-day Cunard to Liverpool.
Electrick fans are impossible to drive away Hon.
Care, all-night elevator can’t not lift a sorry man
out of himself and it ain’t no use to go Liverpool
in one 5-days boat if Hon. Trouble have got there
first.</p>

<p>In newspaper-press I see about one Professor of
Oklahoma University which discover a very surprised
Science. He have found how to do it to
abolish Old Age by electricity. Following is
recipe to do it at home:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—Choose one ripe old man enjoying decline of
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span></p>

<p>2—Take him in very dark room and soak him
24 hours in bath of sulphurick acid.</p>

<p>3—Rub to delicious dryness, simmer him over
oil stove &amp; expose to sunstroke, 20 minutes.</p>

<p>4—He is then ready to abolish by electricity.
Do this by fastening storage battery to base
of brain and increasing dose till 105 centigrades
is enjoyed.</p>

<p>5—Old man ought to be pretty active by this
space of time. If not he is too spoiled. Try
another one.</p>

</div>

<p>I am excitable about this recipe, Mr. Editor,
because I got one Grandfather residing in
Yeddo who is now 97 old and will not keep very
longer in that climbate. If I arrive back to dear
Japan before he pass off I shall do friendship
duty to abolish Grandfather by electricity.</p>

<p class="tb">In newspaper press I discover about Sir Olive
Lodge, nearly related to Senator Lodge from
Boston. Hon. Sir Lodge say-how that disembowled
spirits of departed dead-ones is frequently
discovered by Science. By evening time, say
Hon. Sir Lodge, when intelligent person is setting
alone to unrobe by bureau he must be sensitive
about knocking. You hear <i>bump-bump</i> on high
wall-paper of bedroom? That are not cause by
Hon. Johnson, boarder upstairs, dropping shoes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
to carpet. My nervus sakes! What is? <i>Thump-thump!</i>
It is wireless Ghost from Away Off
trying to act interesting.</p>

<p>“What require?” you must ask to know from
Hon. Ghost.</p>

<p>“I am Napoleon Bonaparte,” say Hon. Ghost
by signal-practise. “I require to leave message
for Cousin Charley at Washington.”</p>

<p>“What to say to this Hon. Charley?” you dictate
for answer.</p>

<p>“Don’t be too dam fierce about Predatory
Richness,” say Napoleon Bonaparte to Charley
Bonaparte. “Remember us Corsican family got
ours by tooking it.”</p>

<p>He is going to say-so some more, but is
shut off by Central for them profane swear he
said it.</p>

<p>Hon. Edison say-so he is going to make one
invention of Spiritualistick Telephone so Americans
can talk with dead persons more conveniently.
This will be nice subjeck to improve. By present
method when persons wishes to correspond with
Ghosts, etc., they must go to Medium who require
50c to throw herself into trances and connect you
with wrong parties. But when them Spiritualistick
Telephones is invent them conversations
with graveyards may be got for price 10c
sum. On them happy time Japanese Boy can go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
to any telephone booth and require of lady
Operette.</p>

<p>“Hello, thank you! Give me to telephone
3604 Spiritland, please! Yes sir! Hello-it—is
Hon. Wm. Shakespeare residing there to talk?
Thank you again! Is them you, Mr. Shakespeare?
One question to reply for Japanese Boy,
please. Who wrote them trajick of Julius Cæsar?
Hon. Bernard Shaw?—No?—He improve it,
you say? Oh, them ain’t no news! Hon. Shaw
know that already. One more reply, please—hello—get
from off the wire, please, Mr.
Thackeray!—”</p>

<p>I am sincerely to hope that persons will get more
better telephone service between Here and
Hereafter than between San Francisco and
Oakland.</p>

<p>An eminent surgery of Columbus University
have invent new species of laughter-gas call
“electrick sleep.” Both tooth &amp; appendix might
be pulled by this Science, Sydney Katsu, Jr., tell
me. Hon. Patience will be in bed dreaming of
something different while everything is removed.
Electrick shock is applied to loeb of brain to create
calm which is followed by whatever knifing is
necessary to create a good-healthy. Absent treatment
may be gave by connecting victim to telegraf
wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span></p>

<p>Hon. Prof. Monsterburg have devise one crafty
Machine which can discover prevaricus Liars by
clock-work. This Hon. Machine are called a
Ananiascope. The apperatux is glued to mouth
of one poor malefactor what is telling his testimonial
to Hon. Judge. While that poor malefactor
say truth Hon. Machine remain very polite
about it; but when he say lie, then Hon. Machine
is so shocked that it ring one alarm clock &amp; that

Hons. Bell, Farman, Wright, Santos-Dumont &amp;
Ben F. Tillman. Lighter-than-air baloons is no
longer consider in vogy. Hotter-than-air machines
is now fashionable for flight. Hon. Bell make
sensationous flight of 8 seconds and travel 14 feet,
breaking New Jersey record &amp; machine. Hon.
Tillman stay up in air 2 hours 14 minutes
and travel from Panama Canal to Philippine
Tariff, landing with considerable jar on the

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, them is but a few number of Scientifick
renovations discover by me in this morning
press. I am not doubtful that I could found a
great number of more by looking in more yellow
colour of news. Science advances, Mr. Sir,
according to speed of paper for which you subscribe
to.</p>

<p>In age of Wm. Jennings Bryan there was one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
famous Frenchman, Hon. Jules Verne, who write
polobrious adventure-book about flying to moon on
cannon-ball, tripping from New York to Pekin
by subway &amp; annexation of America to Africa
by floating islands. In age of Roosevelt Hon.
Verne is consider one very truthful old gentleman,
but too slow &amp; quiet about telling facts. Any
Hon. Reporter on newspaper what can not discover
more exciting scientifick news for morning
edition would be suppressed for lack of talents &amp;
put to writing real-estate forecasts on back column.</p>

<p>Time of Medieval Superstition are pass-by, Mr.
Editor, and I am congratulate on it. Christians
is very skeptic about believing that Hon. World

But if extra edition of <i>Morning Bagpipe</i> should

<span class="smaller">THE HON. MARS</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, September 30th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper who make me
to think of astronomical subjecks.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Sir</span>—Considerable scientists has
been making observations of Hon. Planet Mars
by very recent time; so I have also been doing
so by use of opera-glasses which I borrow secretively
from Sydney Katsu, Jr., Japanese dentistry.
For time of several nights I have regarded this
Star with fixed eye for long moments together, but
I have not enjoyed to discover them famous Canals
because I not could see them, thank you. And
yet perhaps this was no fault blame of Hon. Mars,
but of them disgusting Katsu glasses what are
dimmed all over and enjoy breakage of right
eyelid. This must make very wrong astronomy.</p>

<p>However is, I am excited to wrote Popular
Science about Hon. Mars because any intelligent
person can do so after turning eye-glasses to
heaven.</p>

<p>Is Hon. Mars inhabited by people? is question
for Japanese Boy. Even if-so it is, why should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
Americans become excited about it? We know
by thoughtful knowledge that nearly all places
is inhabited by something. Are we not-so familiar
with fact that Ireland is inhabited? No excitement
about that! Does we not know exactly that
New Jersey is inhabited? No excitement about
that, except on Presidential year! Then why
should Hon. Mars receive all this free advertisement?
I ask to know.</p>

<p>American scientist say, “In near adjoining
future we shall make talk with them Mars
persons.” So foolish to try! We are acquaintanceship
with too many people already. Then
why should we travel by telescopes trying to make
back-talk with stars? Maybe Americans will
be peevishly careful about associating with Mars
persons when they see them. Maybe American
labour unions will send letter of protest to Emperor
of Mars about allowing them disgusting immigrants
all over California. Maybe coolie gentlemans
from Mars will try get job of work in Vancouver
cannery and enjoy kick-out by race-riot.
Oh! such delicious laugh for all Japanese Boys!!</p>

<p>No, Mr. Editor, it is a very nervus task for
these U. S. to encourage foreign relations with
stars, planets, islands and other heathens what
they do not know nothing about. America one
time did open up Japan in them careless manner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
and very soonly she have one Yellow Peril on
fingers. By same operation she open up Philippine
Islands and immediately Hon. Taft become
embarrassed by enormous family of brown complexions.
If Hon. Roosevelt is appointed Emperor
of America once more-time would it be convenient
to send Hon. Taft on trip to Mars to make
once more Manila speech about “Our Little
Green Brother?” I ask no reply.</p>

<p class="tb">No human person have yet been to Mars with
exception of Hon. H. G. Wells, who stops at
nothing. So he write freely for the Magazines.
He go to Mars, he say, with letter of introduction
to Mayors, Politicians, etc., and have intimate &amp;
confidential chatter with them inhabitants. These
Mars persons, say Hon. Wells, lives in elaborate
cities what closely resembles Coney Island.
They are very swift about place-to-place movements
which is done by shooting the chutes. By
government they are Socialistic with a Pianola
attachment. Children of these Mars persons
is born in incubators and educated by Absent
Treatment. The inhabitants of Mars is delightfully
different from the inhabitants of Maine.
The inhabitants of Maine talks through their
noses while the inhabitants of Mars talks through
their ears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>Mars, say Hon. Wells, is so circumscribed by
light-minded atmosphere that persons can talk
there on heaviest subjecks without enjoying pain.
Persons with feathers sprouting from them in
inexperienced places may be seen in baloons
speaking about Tariff, Aldrich Currency Bill,
Ultimate Destiny of College-bred Womans and
other topical thoughts what can be dropped in
that delicious atmosphere without causing sounds.
This planet is pretty ideal. Old Age has also been
abolished by Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, if Mars is like Hon. Wells say it is,
somebody should be punished for discovering it.</p>

<p>Some other Professors has wrote for magazines
about this Hon. Mars in very statistical language.
Sydney Katsu, Jr., when he arrive to remove me
from them opera-glasses, show me one respectable
magazine full of alarming portraits of Mars with
stripes all over it. He say they was took by Hon.
Prof. Lowell, an astronomy who went to Arizona.</p>

<p>“Why should a tame Professor go to Arizona?”
I require with suspicious expression.</p>

<p>“Hon. Prof. Lowell go to Arizona to see Hon.
Mars,” collapse this Sydney.</p>

<p>“Do Hon. Mars live in Arizona?” I deploy for
ignorance.</p>

<p>“It is estimated to be beyond it,” signify
Sydney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“You are a very toothsome dentistry,” I dally
forth. “Please, then, told me what species of
Politics is enjoyed by this Hon. Mars?”</p>

<p>“Hon. Mars is solidly Republican by Politics,”
say Sydney, “because I am aware.”</p>

<p>“What make you so aware?” I require for
curiosity.</p>

<p>“Because-so this,” manifest Sydney. “Some
distinct Professor say in Magazine, ‘Mars is
considerably cut up with 10,000 Panama Canals!’”</p>

<p>“What do this prove about Hon. Republican
Party?” I require.</p>

<p>“It prove plenty,” say Sydney. “Would
Democratic Administration dig 10,000 Panama
Canals on such a planet? Would Hon. Henry
Watterson permit such a great shovel? Ah, no!!
Republican Party is blame for putting all them
surgery on face of Mars!”</p>

<p>“Them 10,000 Panama Canals must took several
Presidential terms to dig it,” I say for philosophy.</p>

<p>“Third terms is often followed by more of it
in some Solar Systems,” embark this Sydney with
J. B. Forker expression.</p>

<p>In discussion of how get there to Mars we was
considerable discouraged persons, thank you.
Railroads might go there by Government Ownership,
but would they? Distance from U. S. to
Hon. Mars is a very extensive row of arithmetic.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
In speaking of such compendious figures it is
easy to drop several millions of miles without
feeling bad about it.</p>

<p>“Such a trip is too expensive,” said Sydney.
“If one Japanese Boy desiring to go to Mars
should travel all over Earth and collect $1 eech
from eech man, womans &amp; children, he would
not yet have sufficient money-pay for trip to Mars.”</p>

<p>“If I had possession of such ability to collect
$1 apiece from all mans, womans &amp; child of this
Earth I would not be particular about going to
Mars,” I renig with American eye-wink.</p>

<p>I then go to bed for brain-ache full of astronomy.</p>

<p class="tb">While setting at my bureau to-night I drop
inkstand and look uply at midnight sky, but I
discover its absence because there is not no
window in the frugality of my bedroom. So I
am satisfied to read one newspaper-print which
is published on Earth each evening. I read about
Hon. Aldrich Porous Plaster Finance, some useless
information about Hon. Terry McGovern, some
intelligent elopement of Bank Presidents and
several other crimes of etiquette with portraiture
on front page. But there is no news about Hon.
Mars. So I am supposing that nothing happens
there frequently. That is a nice fact to know
about Mars, if nothing else is discovered. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
pleasant for Japanese Boy to imagine that this
planet is not civilized like Hon. Wells and other
prophets say-so about it. It is sweet to thought
that none of them machinery like sky-scrape,
elevator, hot-and-cold-water, subway &amp; gasolene
is inhabiting that Hon. Star. How much more
dearer would it be for Japanese Boy if Hon.
Mars was just one plain-finish Planet where refined
persons could go after death to set inside their
souls and get away from this noisy panick of
ottomobiles!</p>

<p>Therefore I got a poem—</p>

Arthur. “It-say, ‘Scratch a Russian and you

<p>“Scratch a Senator and you strike Oil,” are
smart quotation for Japanese Schoolboy.</p>

<p class="tb">Hon. Roosevelt have just called Hon. Bryan a
Chimera. That were a very mean curse. A
Chimera, Mr. Editor, are a horid nature-fake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
discovered in a vacant lott by Baccus, a prominent
Greek drunkard. This queery mammal start in
to resemble a goat, but he lost interest in the subjeck
about the middle of his body, so he continue
on backwards in a squimyform appendix to
look like a bow constricktor. The goatly part
of this beast, Mr. Editor, are mild and fond
of common people and he love to nibble vegetarian
diet in Utopia where he live; but the
rear extension of that Chimera continue to point
in the direction of Wall Street where it make
wig-wag signals of distress. The farm-yard
part of them Chimera were born in 1896, but
the wiggly part were nailed on at the Denver
Convention this year.</p>

<p>Hon. John Burro say that animals do not think.
The Chimera are an animal. Hon. Roosevelt
agree with John Burro on all subjecks.</p>

<p>Hon. Hearst, when he discover Hon. Haskle
and Hon. Forker in act of Standard Oiling,
done a pretty fine servis to this kingdom of
America. When I think of all that good he
done I extend my hand to Hon. Hearst—and
then apologize to my Hand. That were a pretty
nice stab which Hon. Hearst made, not because
he hated Haskle less, but because he hated
Bryan more.</p>

<p>S. Wanda, Japanese Socialist, say that Hon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
Hearst done what he did for love of truth &amp; justis.
Hope so he did! But when Hon. Hearst do things
for love of truth &amp; justis I enjoy suspicious feeling
of elbow. I am reminded of a mustylogical legend
of antique Japan.</p>

<p>Ten thousand entire years before Hon. Darwin
discovered monkeys in England there reside in
Kyoto a politician name Suki-ho who run for Supervisor
on Democratick ticket &amp; was beat by a
nother politician name Yen-Yen. When this result
was happened Hon. Suki-ho enjoy such angry
rages he turn entirely blue &amp; blow smoke through
ears. Oftenly he motter, “I make a lay-to for
this Yen-Yen.”</p>

<p>One day when it was serious heat of July Hon.
Suki-ho meet a entirely mad dog &amp; enjoy being
bit on ankle.</p>

<p>“O banzai of joy!” decry this patient. “I
soonly shall develop a rabbi. Then I shall bite
my dog O-Fido so he will get it.”</p>

<p>“Why you wish bite O-Fido?” require all neighbour
for shocky voice. “You got grouches for
them nice pet?”</p>

<p>“O-Fido are sweet companion,” arnicate that
Suki-ho, “but I shall deelight to see him bite pet
dog of Hon. Yen-Yen with a wild germ.”</p>

<p>“You got gruj for them lap-dog of Hon. Yen-Yen?”
they ask it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>“Not by no means,” erupt Hon. Suki-ho, “but
if I bite O-Fido &amp; O-Fido bite lap-dog of Yen-Yen,
then lap-dog will bite Yen-Yen—and <i>he</i>
are the sinful crawfishing malefactor I are anxious
to get equal with.”</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, they was not no Pastor Institute in
them days, so Hon. Suki-ho were hit in skull with
pick-ax before he could snarl at O-Fido. And it
were too bad, because Hon. Yen-Yen’s dog were
a pretty predatory canan.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, what-say Hon. Matt Luther in
Germany some bye-gones since? He say, “Be
true to your trust and you will get reward in
Heaven.” Numberous American patriots has make
hark-up to them words of Hon. Luther &amp; been
very useful to both Parties. But they got their
rewards in several kinds of elsewhere. Hon.
Haskle was true to his trust &amp; got his reward in
Oklahoma. Hon. Forker was true to his trust and
got his reward in bank deposits. Both are good
ways to know.</p>

<p>Them two extinguished statesmen are alike to
Matt Luther in another way. Hon. Luther
enjoyed a Diet of Worms. Hon. Haskle &amp; Hon.
Forker are now enjoying a Diet of Wormwood and
feeling considerable gall about it. And Hon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
Roosevelt are having more fun than he can shake
a Stick at.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HON. BOMB</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, October 14th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper, who is there,
I suppose.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—“Hon. Russia have no Constitution,”
say Cousin Nogi from newspaper. “She
require to get one with considerable quick.”</p>

<p>“Of what use is Hon. Constitution to got it?”
I enquire for answer.</p>

<p>“It is good thing to follow flags,” dictate Nogi
who presume so.</p>

<p>“Constitution would have had delicious job
following Russian flag in Manchuria,” I collapse
with Port Arthur eye-wink.</p>

<p>“Hon. Russia expect to obtain freedom in soon
space of time,” simplify this Nogi.</p>

<p>“How she expects to got them freedom?”
I ask to know.</p>

<p>“By bombs &amp; bombast,” agitate Nogi.</p>

<p>“Do Hon. Bombs get freedom for persons?”
I exemplify.</p>

<p>“Of sure it do!” say Nogi. “If one Revolutional
gentleman make step-up to me with hand-clasp<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
full of lit bombs and decry, ‘Give me freedom
for Hon. Russia before I excite this dynamite!’
what I reply to them speek? I reply,
‘To be certainly, Mr. Murder. Took all the freedom
you require for Hon. Russia and do not worry
about returning it.’”</p>

<p>“You are ashamed!” I snub for scorn. “Japanese
samurai should not enjoy fear of explosions.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t not afraid of explosions,” he-say. “I
am merely modest about loud noises.”</p>

<p>Nogi would make very neat Czar for Russia.</p>

<p>Of recently, Mr. Editor, I hear one Hon.
Anarchist speek about them Revolution which
is being postponed in Russia. This gentleman is
very courageous with whiskers which he wear
in all directions. He say following statistick
about Hon. Bomb:</p>

<p>“Something are wrong about them Hon.
Bombs made in St. Petersburg. They don’t
never explode when requested to do so. Hon.
Bombs made in Japan is more better for assassinations,
because they is very faithful about going
off.” This from Hon. Anarchist.</p>

<p>Them truth about Hon. Bombs, Mr. Editor, is
difference between all-every-thing did by Russia
&amp; Japan. Japanese persons make war; it go
off, thank you. Russian persons make war; it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
sizzle out by oratory. Hon. Bomb of Japan is
very energetick &amp; dutiful; Hon. Bomb of Russia
is full of free-love policies, vodka, Gorky, shoe-buttons
&amp; face-powder. When requested to go
off it hesitate with insulting splutters, make deceptive
pretence of going to sleep; and when, of
finally, it <i>do</i> explode, it enjoy that eruption in
vest-pocket of Hon. Nihilinsky, who is waiting
on steps of Sts. Peter &amp; Paul to salute Little
Father.</p>

<p>Russian Revolution is entirely like that way.
Nothing Russian goes off on time. Even their
boots is difficult to remove promptly and with their
hair it is impossible to do so. Some wise Revolutionals
say, “What Russia need is one good
program.” So fudge to think! Genius of Russia
people is all-time making delicious programs which
is forgotten, thank you, before Hon. Duma gets
a chance to talk about something else. Russia
has greatest statesmen and poorest politicians of
all-world.</p>

<p>When Russian Revolutional leader gets took
with a dream he say, “Ah! I have got a Program!”
Immediate sensation enjoyed among Red Wing
of Holy Terror Synod.</p>

<p>“What to do with?” require Hon. Snortsky,
Radical Leader from Dynamitovitch Province.</p>

<p>“To read it,” say Hon. Leader. So he fold out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
following Program which he read with considerable
elocution:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> to-night Russian people will meet
at Smithsky’s Vodka Parlours and declare
themselves free of the yoke of Ramanoff.</p>

<p>2—11.30 they will go sneekretly with brass band
to grocery store of Samsky Jonesoff and
sign Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>3—12.30 they will stand together and give
pass-key word of Revolution “Potempotemptomjinvery,”
which will be sign for up-rise
of peasants in Baltick Province.</p>

<p>4—1.30 they will go to bed, setting infernal
machines for 8.29, when get-up will ensue.</p>

<p>5—9.30 all common people of Russia will go to
Nevsky Prospeckt, where Hon. Czar &amp;
bullet-proof procession will make pass-by
going to Peace Conference at Hague. Hon.
Czar, wife &amp; family, Grand Duke Splurgius,
Grand Duchess Nazimova and all other
persons with such names will enjoy blow-up
with infernal machines.</p>

<p>6—Russia will then become Constitutional
Republick with plans furnished by Bluejean
V. Debs.</p>

</div>

<p>This delicious Program are given to Russian
people who, with fanatick enthusiasm, carry it
out as following:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> enormous number of Revolutionals
meets at Smithsky’s Vodka Parlours.
Speeches, vodka &amp; debate. All infernal
machines cleaned &amp; repaired. Debate,
vodka &amp; speeches. Famous Liberal Leaders
made welcome. Vodka &amp; debate. Red
Wing of Holy Terror do some very serious
politicks. Vodka.</p>

<p>2—11.30 they all forget to go to grocery store
of Samsky Jonesoff where Declaration of
Independence is waiting to be signed.</p>

<p>3—12.30 they forget how to pronounce “Potempotemptomjinvery,”
so they don’t.</p>

<p>4—1.30 they forget to go to bed.</p>

<p>5—9.30 they forget to go to Nevsky Prospeckt
and Czar forgets to go by in procession to
Hague.</p>

</div>

<p>Sometime, Mr. Editor, this Program are one
trifle more fortunate. Sometime 12 or 13 of
common people of Russia remember to go to
Nevsky Prospeckt at 9.30, carrying mottoes, flags,
infernal machinery &amp; other patriotick devices.
Pretty soonly along come Little Father in bomb-proof
carriage.</p>

<p>“Gen. Creepoff,” he say to Chief of Police,
“what are all them tick-tock sounds I hear like
busy day in Waterbury Watch factory?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span></p>

<p>“Them,” say Gen. Creepoff, “are infernal
machinery of Russian people waiting to give
your Majesty God-speed.”</p>

<p>“What time is them machinery set for?” say
Majesty rubbing pale nerves at elbow.</p>

<p>“For 9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>, Hon. Sire,” say Gen.</p>

<p>“Drive onwards, Hon. Coachman,” say Little
Father with smiling expression. “Them infernal
machinery will not go off before 1.30, because
every clock in St. Petersburg is 4 hours slow!”</p>

<p>And so it do happen. Them patent exploders
lay in gutter waiting with loud clock-work noise till
afternoon-time. They don’t see no aristocracy
worth blowing up, so they don’t. But with
immediate promptness at 1.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> all them
machine make smash-off and kill parade of Cigar
Makers’ Union out on strike.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, one gentleman of New York, of
recently, throw bomb to Hon. Police who afterward
pick him together from fence &amp; trees. He
was Nihilist gentleman who was practising.
Bombs is more noisy than pianos when practised
on, but they has less endurance. When Hon.
Police with club enquire of them Hon. Nihilist,
“Why did you done them explosion with Hon.
Bomb?” he make reply for answer, “Because-so
I am disagreeable about your politicks.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>Bombs is very wrong things to have around
when you are disagreeable about anything. I ask
to know; what would be result if all persons done
that for argument? I am disagreeable about
W. Furo who come around with Italian garlick
in his voice. Must I bomb him for it? I am
offended by Hon. Strunsky, Irish gentleman
who keeps saloon. Shall I make bang-up of him
because of? Must I explode all labour unions,
Democrats, Christians and troubles of life, including
Cousin Nogi, who is secretive about my
refined shirt he borrow for Sunday next? Ah no!
Dynamite are too expensive to be so generous
with.</p>

<p>I am regretful, Mr. Editor, to see them foreign
species of explosions being brought over to this
kingdom of America where murder has always
been very simple &amp; democratick. It are nassuating
to Japanese Boy to see them Baltick propoganders
dropping deathly fireworks into Union
Square, N. Y. It is one sneeky trick. How
much more honest and straight-fronted are it
to see one Southern Congressman shoot negro
vote in street-car of Washington! Black Handed
Association of Italian secret knife-stick are very
doggish case of lowdown deprave; but Night
Riding Association of American lynchers is considered
very necessary band of patriotick terrors.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
When Black Handers shoot Italian banker it is
call “imported crime;” when Night Riders shoot
Southern farmer it is call “American custom.”
There are great difference between them acts,
but both are good ways to know.</p>

<p>There is some philanthropists what goes around
Hon. World bombing kings, emperors, etc.,
whenever one is met.</p>

<p>“Why you explode them kings &amp; emperors?”
I enquire to know of one Hon. Asassin I meet at
sidewalk.</p>

<p>“Because-so,” say Hon. Asassin, “by sufficient
bombing, shoot-gun &amp; poison of soup I expect
to rid Hon. World of its entire rulers.”</p>

<p>“Such childhood thought!” I decline. “When
you kill Hon. Emperor, what happen? There is
still Hon. President. When you kill Hon. President,
how yet? There is still Hon. Sec. of State.
Him asassinated, then there remain House of
Representators, which might be blew up, but
Governors of all States must be also exploded, to
remove rulers. Then which? Then there is
Mayors of towns to gunpowder, then political
Boss of each election district. When them is
erupted Hon. Aldermans must enjoy gunshot
wound. They are dead. What next? Then
city hall employees, street cleaning department,
board of healthful &amp; all clerks of city treasury.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
All buried with funerals. Oh my! We have
forgot to dynamite Hon. Police Department. <i>That</i>
are a job for considerable chemicals, but it can
be done by patient bombing. Pretty soonly
nothing of Hon. Police but smoke &amp; occasional
brass buttons as souvenirs. What then? Each
grown man with American moustache arise to
wife and say, ‘I am ruler of this homested!’
Bang for him! Pretty good job of explosion.
After this, basso voice of mans is very hard to
hear. No gentlemans left in Hon. World except
small collection of Hon. Anarchists which is all
running for President on Independent ticket.”</p>

<p>“And what must ensue then?” aggrope Hon.
Anarchist with bomb.</p>

<p>“Then,” I snuggest, “country must select
ruler. Nothing to do but to elect one Anarchist,
which do not believe in rulers. Therefore Anarchists
boom bomb to each other till all are minus
by decease.”</p>

<p>“Banzai!” say Anarchist. “When all are
thus dead there will be nobody remaining to be
rulers! Such ideal affairs!!”</p>

<p>“Such is wrong statistick,” I say. “When
men is all dead, then will be fine politicks for
Suffergettes.”</p>

<p>Hon. Anarchist hear this and disjoint himself
with groans. When person sets out to explode<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
all Rulers in this Hon. World we have got too
large Fourth of July for Powder Trust to handle.</p>

<p>Hoping you will be in time for red flag before
blow-off,</p>

<p class="center">Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Hashimura Togo</span>.</p>

<p>S. P.—I know it! Last night by street-corner
Anarchist oratory say-so “soil of Russia is
wet with tear-drops of walked-over peasantry.”
Maybe that is trouble with Russian bombs.</p>

<span class="smaller">ENJOYMENT OF HUNGER AMONG POOR MANS</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, October 18th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To my friendship companion, Editor New York
newspaper, which is a very warm thing.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr.</span>—When Hon. Taft make Presedential
Speech to idle labouring classes in N. Y. of
recently, one Hungry Man in audience send up
following question to know:</p>

<p><i>“How can I get job and food when I have not
got it?”</i></p>

<p>Hon. Taft, which had been answering with
prompt delivery such fearful difficult questions like
“How to shut up the Tariff?” “What was dying
speech of Ralph Waldo Emerson?” “Was Hamlet
insane?” etc., make moment of solum hesitation
before large simplicity of that Hungry Man
question,</p>

<p><i>“How can I get job &amp; food when I have not
got it?”</i></p>

<p>For sixty-four seconds of clock-time he pause
wiping dew-drop from neck, then, standing
seriously with elbows in pockets, he make following
famous reply,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>“God knows!”</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I don’t not believe that Hon. Taft
referred that reply to higher authority because of
ignorance inside of brain. Hon. Taft is kind &amp;
wise Judge of considerable practice—then why
he not able to answer in 64 seconds that Question
what labouring classes have been enquiring to
know in North Dakota, South Dakota, Europe,
Asia &amp; Africa for 64 centuries? How can he be
very nice President for these U. S. if not?</p>

<p>May be-so Hon. Taft will give some serious
brain-thought to this problem before nomination-day.
If he is too busy with himself to do it,
Japanese Boy will told him how to find out. Go,
please at once and read editorial-page of Hon.
Hearst, where all Great Questions, including
marriage, socialism, underwear, care of teeth,
religion, horse-racing, etc., is answered to delicious
satisfaction of all persons who read nothing else.
Hon. Taft would not say “God only knows!”
after such instructive course of reading.</p>

<p class="tb">But in the meanwhile, what have happen to
that Hungry Man? If he is still waiting for meal-time
he must be enjoying considerable Social
Unrest, because Hunger and Social Unrest are
very affectionate chumbs. Hon. Wilshire have
heard of this Hungry Man question “How to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
get food when not got it?” and Hon. Wilshire
answer with considerable speed, “By changing
the Existing Order of Things.” That is very
intelligible reply, but I ask to know: Can that
Hungry Man wait for lunch while Hon. Wilshire
changes Existing Order of Things?</p>

<p>There is considerable conversation to be
heard about changing Existing Order of Things.
Maybe so it can be. But some kind gentleman
what would change Existing Disorder of Things
would receive more solid Japanese Vote.</p>

<p>I. Anazuma, Japanese barber of Taft enthusiasm,
deploy, “Hungry Man can enquire of
Charity for it.”</p>

<p>I make considerable banzai with laugh.</p>

<p>“Faith, Hope &amp; Charity is celebrated triplets
for sculptors to make,” I allude. “Persons must
have elaborate amounts of Faith &amp; Hope to obtain
some Charity out of them organizations of it.”</p>

<p>“How deserving must poor be to obtain groceries
for it?” ask this Anazuma.</p>

<p>So I tell this Japanese barber following yarn-tale
of charity while he was putting hair-cut on
my head:</p>

<p>Hon. Oscar Casey, dough-baker for wages,
suddenly become unemployed by no job. He
would be delighted to make bread somewhere, but
he is not required there, thank you. So he soonly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
begin enjoying hunger &amp; faint symptoms of
esophagus. He make street-walk to see what.
In midst of promenading he observe one intensely
beautiful sky-scrape palace with sign on it</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">“ORGANIZED MAGNATE CHARITY CO.”</span></p>

<p>“Oh ha!” say Hon. Casey for blissful ankles.
“I will apply myself to this charitable place and
require some of it.”</p>

<p>In Italian marble hallway Elevator Man meet
him to enquire,</p>

<p>“Name, if convenient!”</p>

<p>“I am name Hon. Oscar Casey, formerly skillful
at dough-baking.”</p>

<p>“This is very wrong doorway for bakers,”
collapse Elevator Man. “Apply to trademan
entrance.”</p>

<p>So down to trademan entrance this Hon. Casey
go, where he is collided by Hon. Janitor.</p>

<p>“What suffering from?” declaim this Hon.
Janitor.</p>

<p>“I am enjoying hunger,” signify this Hon.
Casey.</p>

<p>“What degree of hunger?” he inquire to know.</p>

<p>“Thirty-third degree, please,” pacify Casey
who is sure of it.</p>

<p>“Have you one Doctor’s Certificate to prove
such a conditional appetite?” decry Hon. Janitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span></p>

<p>“I have neglected to get!” profess this Casey.</p>

<p>“Then go get!” say Janitor. “Come back next
Wednesday-noon with doctoring Certificate to
prove you are habitually hungry; also deliver
references from 3 clubs and 2 banks to prove that
you are financially responsible.”</p>

<p class="tb">Saying-so thus Janitor make slam-door.</p>

<p>Hon. Casey exist, maybe, on Faith &amp; Hope
waiting for Charity to arrive by Wednesday-noon.
That day he apply again to Janitor of
Organized Magnate Charity.</p>

<p>“Have you brung them certificate?” demand
that stern office.</p>

<p>“No, not to do, because I feel foolish to,” say
Hon. Casey.</p>

<p>“If you feel so foolish,” say Hon. Janitor,
“apply for ade to Home for Feebly Minded.”
So to Feebly Minded Residence elope that hopeful
Casey.</p>

<p>“What required, please?” say lady matron of
that weak-thinking place.</p>

<p>“Something to eat it!” demand Hon. Casey.
Matron of soft-memory headquarters look very
severe with face.</p>

<p>“Why did you not require at Organized Magnate
Charity Co. for it?”</p>

<p>“I done so, please,” say Casey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>“And what of?” collapse Hon. Matron.</p>

<p>“They treat me like dog!” say him.</p>

<p>“Quite well,” deploy Hon. Madam. “Then
you should apply to Society for Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals for helping aid.”</p>

<p>Hon. Casey limp to Animal Cruelty place, but
is kept outside with other sickly dogs while fashionable
millinary inside listens to lecture on
“Crimes of Vivisection.”</p>

<p>What, then, can Casey do for luncheon which
is becoming impatient? Where he go to obtain
job of situation? When man ask for work in
Pennsylvania they say, “Go to California.”
When he inquire for employment in California
they decry, “Go to Arizona.” When he report
for job in Arizona they proclaim, “Go to Blazes!”
But by this time he no can do, because car-fare
is too exhausted to continue travelling.</p>

<p>Hungry Man desiring to become criminal might
burst in some bank—but what would he find if
he did?</p>

<p class="tb">I am a schoolfriend of Frank the Japanned
Bootpolish, who is a very thoughtful caretaker
for shines on all feet with no extra charge for
tan &amp; Russian leather. His name, which is pronounce
“Frank” in America-language, is called
Kurumazitsu Ubunodzuruma in Japanese-talk.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
Nearly every <i>u</i> in this name is pronounced silently,
please, which make a very delicious noise for all
Japanese to hear. But America-mans cannot
neglect business to finish such words: therefore
they say “Frank,” which is good short-order name
for Christians to use.</p>

<p>This Frank, who is studying to be a Anarchist,
come to me yesterday to use my room-rent.</p>

<p>“One million mans is now idly looking for
work,” he-say.</p>

<p>“In what city?” I require to examine. He is
hesitated by confusion.</p>

<p>“I am neglectful to enquiry,” he profess.
“Maybe it was in New York or Chicago. It is
difficult to suspect Syracuse or Toledo of so much
idle population.”</p>

<p>“Figures is habitually truthful,” I suffocate
in kind voice. “Therefore it is important to
discover how to obtain jobs of employment for
them 1,000,000 mans.”</p>

<p>“Some 150,000 of them persons belongs to
idly wealthy classes,” renig this Frank. “It
would be insulting to offer them jobs of employment.”</p>

<p>“I am relieved to hear,” I report. “It is our
duty, then, to find work for merely 850,000 human
persons who are not now doing so.”</p>

<p>“This is not hard problemb for 2 bright Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Boys to answer,” promote that Hon. Frank
sharpening pencil.</p>

<p>So with immediate quickness we find employment
for them 850,000 workers by following
statistick:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">100,000</td>
    <td>is to have jobs on Police Force which is never sufficiently enough.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">250,000</td>
    <td>is to be joined to Stand-up Army which Gen. Hobson requires to fight Japan or any other friendly Power.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">75,000</td>
    <td>to be kerosene-sprinkles &amp; encourage mosquitos to race-suicide.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">100,000</td>
    <td>to be Bill-collectors &amp; take fines away from Quelled Corporations.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">50,000</td>
    <td>circus-riders to join Roosevelt’s Rough Officers’ Class.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr" style="border-top: thin solid black;">575,000</td>
    <td>for sum-total who we have got jobs for.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>That leaved 275,000 still looking for work which
Frank refused to find for them because he was
enjoying considerable head-ache. We might have
did some kindness of act for them, but could we?
If Hon. Taft, when asked “How shall able-body
worker get it?” must reply for answer “God
knows!” is not Japanese Boys excusable for forgetting
a few thousand?</p>

<p>Them 275,000 workers might do digging operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
on Panama Canal, but would they? Climbate
is too much miasma down so low in the map.
Hon. Frank the Japanned Bootpolish say-how
that Hon. Roosevelt might move Panama Canal
to New Jersey where climbate is more callabrious.
This is a very brilliant plan for Congress to ignore.</p>

<p>If them million mans is idly unemployed is it
fault of America because? Many American
patriots who says these U. S. have very wicked
government are persons which comes from Baltic
provinces of Russia where common people is not
wonderfully successful about governing therselves.
Can Pres. Roosevelt obtain cheerful advice from
them persons which is only happy when enjoying
misery?</p>

<p>Yet it is not best-beautiful thing for any kingdom
to have 1,000,000 mans idly unemployed.
Hon. Chancellor Day, famous Socialist, say it is
all to blame of Pres. Roosevelt who done it.
Maybe so it is. In great Christian country like
this it is very dangerous experiment to preach the
law “Thou shalt not steal.” Panick of fear is
apt to follow with general shut-up of factories,
trust companies &amp; other religious institutions.</p>

<p class="tb">Hon. Forker say, “This kingdom need some
new President what will restore publick Confidence.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span></p>

<p>Such brightness of idea! Let us have get-together
and elect Hon. Forker so that all publick
Confidence Men can be restored to power!</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ALCOHOLIC TEMPERANCE MOVEMENT</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, October 22d.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor of New York Newspaper which is
often read by all Japanese who can afford
it, I assure you.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—I am given to be told by some
wise Editors, etc., that these U. S. is now enjoying
the temperance of Prohibition in many States and
more too. Although I can not notice such a
movement in this street, perhaps it is slightly true.
In several sections of this kingdom whisky-drunking
is becoming unknown by law, salooners
is quitting that sinfulness &amp; all bar-keeps is
retiring from that public office. In South, army
of reform is playing “Marching Through Georgia”
on water-pitchers. Is this a truthful news what
I hear? I enquire to know, so I can go there,
please.</p>

<p>By newspaper print I read this early morning:
“Wave of temperance against salooners is creeping
in direction of New York.” First I greet this
with glad banzai, then I am depressed of thought.
Wave of temperate prohibition is on road to New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
York, but will it arrive there? And if it should
do this, what will happen to it when got there?
That is problem for Japanese Boy.</p>

<p>And yet I am earnest to say it. Prohibition of
drunk is a comfortable blessing to demand,
because it is very difficulty for white persons to
be tame when exposed to wild beverages. Irish,
Swedish, Italian &amp; Jewish is most useful for
calamities by feeding them whisky. Japanese is
also too patriotic when enjoying bun-bun.</p>

<p class="tb">In the great cities of America where persons
is brought together for living over each other by
sky-scrape apartment the sell of whisky spoil the
low layers of society. Labouring classes stop
being it because of alcohol poison and other
ingredients to be found in it. Labourer so
poisoned can not support dear wife &amp; child
because he is resting in jail for what he done.
This is especially true of Chicago.</p>

<p>Tip-top layers of society also enjoy poison from
this liquour curse, but they are less pitiful because
they do not rest in jail. Salooners must not be
forsaken by wealthy persons because these can
still be respected when least respectable. But
salooners must be closed up from low layers of
society which must continue to work and keep up
appearances of great city. If not these, who would?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span></p>

<p>Whisky is divided into four kinds of bottle by
following statistick:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Whisky of Scottish descent to be drunk
standing up.</p>

<p>2. Whisky of Irish descent to be drunk setting
down.</p>

<p>3. Whisky of American nationality to be took
in bed.</p>

<p>4. Whisky of patent medical origin to be took
before death.</p>

</div>

<p>None of these beverages must be taken
without family physician. Alcohol do most
injury to cities. In country districts it is less
harmful because there is more room for it to
stampede.</p>

<p>At the Sunday school of which I am a membership
to learn languages, etc., we there have Japanese
Boy Temperance League which meet every
Tuesday night for prohibition conversation. I
attend to this meeting regularity, because free
lemonade of delightful sourness is furnished free.
Hon. Miss K. N. McGee, Christian lady of light-weight
beauty, come there to teach us how to do
so. She instruct us in the song-sing melody,
“Cold Water is the Drunk for Me,” and explain
about the various mocking qualities of wine.
When she say “wine is mocker” do she mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
about some wine which is imitation of some other
brand? She does not answer to reply.</p>

<p>She say, “Mr. Togo, you must not drunk any
drink however mild, because this lead to stronger
and stronger yet till gray hairs to sorry grave.”</p>

<p>“Do water-drunking lead to lemonade drunking?”
I require.</p>

<p>“Maybe so it might,” she otter.</p>

<p>“So thus, do lemonade-drunking result for
soda-water thirsty?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps is,” she contradict.</p>

<p>“Then if, do soda-water collapse to ginger-ale
tonic?”</p>

<p>“I signify it.”</p>

<p>“And this then: Might Japanese Boy what
is raised by ginger-ale crave for beer-drunking
from this?”</p>

<p>“I am dangerous to reply,” say this Hon. Miss
McGee.</p>

<p>“So sorry to hear!” I terminate. “Because
weak-drunk lead to strong-drunk, strong-drunk to
powerful-drunk—and yet you say it! What
for you teach Japanese Boy ‘Cold Water is the
Drunk for Me’? Water lead to lemonade,
lemonade to soda-water, soda-water to ginger-ale,
ginger-ale to beer-glass—sakes of living! What
to do with this thirsty?”</p>

<p>“Togo,” she commute, “you are too foolish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
to learn what of. This evening-time when
lemonade is pass around you must avoid it because
too tempting.”</p>

<p>I listen, and yet I will not do so.</p>

<p class="tb">The reason why I make disagreeable argument
about the temperance is not because I do not
believe it is good for all human animals. O no!
It is most best blessing for those communities
which desire to be cleanly and modern plumbing.
But why should this hon. lady be so Christian in
the way she say it? Can only Christians be
prohibition? What about heathens like I am-so
who do not care about wine-sip &amp; beer-gulp?
Must they accompany this quietness of thirst
with song-sing about cold water? Answer is,
No! Many heathens is very abstemperous
of stomach. Many Christians is not. Many
Christians when become filled up with alcohol
feel obliged to make crimes including boastful
talk which lead to murder of something. Will
driving out of salooners in business do good for
those bad persons? I hope to be.</p>

<p>To enquire about what will happen to salooners
when drove out I go to Hon. Strunsky, Irish
gentleman who conduct saloon.</p>

<p>“Honourable sir,” I magnify, “if the legal laws
of this San Francisco become prohibition, so sorry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
for you! What would you do with this saloon
to make profitable wealth from it?”</p>

<p>“That is easy to reply,” say Hon. Strunsky.
“I would turn it into a drug store.”</p>

<p>I am shuddering when I think of that deceptive
man.</p>

<p class="tb">I have obtained a slight job of employment
waiting on table-board of Fujiyama Restaurant,
H. Sunigawa, Prop. This profession give me $2
weekly sum, also three times daily to eat it.
As addition to money sum I receive $1 weekly from
my cousin Nogi to help him do Japanese spy
work. From this sum of $3 weekly pay I expend
it away as following:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Schoolbooks which I can not borrow</td>
    <td class="tdr">.55</td>

    <td class="tdr" style="border-top: thin solid black;">$1.66</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>After this money has went you can count it,
Mr. Editor. I have to keep $1.34 of weekly cash
which I will save together for sufficient boat-fare
to go back Japan. Maybe I will not go at that
time—if so I will do something else and get
married.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>Of evening time I am frequent to attend lectures
where I learn facts of intelligence very cheap.
Last night I go to speech of Dr. O. Sumuchi,
Japanese surgery, on subjeck of “Alcohol Inside
of People.” Hon. Dr. Sumuchi had most beautiful
lecture because of magic-lantern showing
human stomach under surprised conditions.
Following charts was showed during lecture:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No. 1.—Pink of colour. Exposure of stomach
during calm moments before alcohol has got there.</p>

<p>No. 2.—More red of colour. Exposure of
stomach which enjoys happy, smiling expression
because alcohol have arrived.</p>

<p>No. 3.—Angry mix of colour. Exposure of
this stomach when alcohol have remain there
too long for polite welcome. Stomach now enjoy
angry rage and desire to quit.</p>

<p>No. 4.—Colour of Scottish plaid. Exposure
of stomach when alcohol have continue to do so
too late. I am sorry for this stomach because it
look so brilliant, yet feel so dull!</p>

</div>

<p>Dr. Sumuchi say so about that stomach when
so fanciful from decoration of alcohol. He say,
“Such stomach is so satisfied by alcohol it will
burn up by striking match to it.”</p>

<p>“Persons enjoying such a stomachs must avoid
swallowing matches,” is answer of Japanese
Schoolboy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span></p>

<p>This is translation from Japanese temperance
legend:</p>

<p>Some time back in astronomy before the
world got a very good start and homely giants
of disgusting profile was employing timber-trees
for tooth-pick, there reside in high top-mountain
one bad Drink Dragon. Now when that there
Drink Dragon got thirsted he was a very serious
snake, thank you. When them giants would hear
one grand roary-sound from mountain they would
make considerable eye-wink and decry, “Hon.
Dragon is enjoying trouble!”</p>

<p>One morning by daylight this great Worm
made landslide down mountain in search of something
with which to squelch his thirsty. Soon
again he come to Hon. Ocean and snuggest, “Good
morning, Mr. Ocean, I have came to drunk you
up, please.”</p>

<p>Then Ocean laugh considerable joke. “This
is pretty wrong place for thirsty Snake to come
for gobbly rejoicing. I am great Prohibition
Wave. Nothing to do, Hon. Serpent!”</p>

<p>Then this Drink Dragon throw fire-engine
sparks from his gills making earthquake and he
go at that Hon. Ocean to devour it up. And
Ocean, with cyclone of storms, rise up on back
legs to meet Hon. Dragon. One, two! they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
arrive together! Such mixing of destruction,
such powerful struggly! Ocean make hiss on red-hot
steam-pipe of Dragon and this Serpent make
hot stew of Ocean. O great jiu jitsu! First
Snake push Ocean to moon, then Ocean drag
Dragon to North Pole. But finally, when both
is tired out, Dragon say, “Excuse it, Mr. Ocean,
while I scratch my eyebrow.” And while Dragon
was doing that peaceful act, Hon. Ocean took
mean advantage and gollup Dragon to deep-down
bottom. But he was not dead. Oh no,
thank you, Snakes is not slewed with this quickness
of speed. Ninety-nine thousand years
relapse and Dragon swim up, one day, on wave of
temperance. And this time he is called Sea
Serpent and is permitted to remain, please.</p>

<p>Moral for this tale is thus:</p>

<p>Water-Wave can not drowned Drink Dragon,
but it can cause very unhappy feelings for that
brutal beast, thank you.</p>

<p>Hoping you are the same,</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SALOON IN OUR TOWN</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco,</span> October 28th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper who offer prize
to letter-writer what can tell storey of best
Drunk and can prove it.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Dear</span>—In our town resides many
Saloons; and when you have saw them all you
will be surprise to find there is several more just
around corner. Many of them Saloons can be
told apart by looking at them. Some of them
is paint bright &amp; goddy colour of a ottomobiles
with screeches at doors where they are red &amp;
purpal. Drunkerds what see that mad-coloured
outside must go inside &amp; forget it. And when
they are inside they must stay there long time for
nervus collapse. When they are inside they
can’t not see the outside—and in such a state
who knows what?</p>

<p>Other Saloons is managed with entire plate-glass
and completely wooden polish all over it to
make deceptive resemblance of First National
Bank, so that refined drunkerds can go there
with a stock-broke feeling. Such Saloons require<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
a paying teller to do barkeeping and be pretty
civilized, thank you. Them palaces is incomplete
if they ain’t got over Hon. Bar a horbly
artistick oily-paint pink portrait of Mrs. Venus the
way she looked when Hon. Columbus discovered
her. She got a hansom gilt frame around her
and nothing else. All them portraits cost $10,000
apiece, because Hon. Barkeep say so.</p>

<p>All Saloons has got a phonograf with exception
of Hotels which has a okestra. Americans which
wishes to become drunk in silence must join a
Club. Hon. Strunsky, Irish salooner, make his
phonograf play “I Am Long about My Old
Contucky Home” because he wish to serve
sweetheart influences with his beer; but Hon.
Sheehan on opp. corner make <i>his</i> phonograf play
“Happy Widow Waltz” and “We Won’t Go
Home in the Darkness” because he-say drunkerds
often gets stingy &amp; reforms when they hears
homesick musick. Hon. Strunsky say they drink
to drown trouble, Hon. Sheehan say they drink
to cause it. Both are good ways to know.</p>

<p class="tb">Tuesday Hon. Strunsky, Irish salooner, give
me temporarial job of work to help persons get
drunk by doing so. I am now not there as usual.
But I learn how-do while I was. In salooning
whisky-drunk are applied to them for price<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
$.10 and beer-drunk for price $.05 eech goblet.
Green persons unacquainted with salooning have
suppose it would be cheaper for drink beer at $.05
for one long quench when whisky cost twict as
much for 1 tinty small splatter of. But such is
truthless. One (1) small jounce from whisky
contain 2 or 3 times more vixen as a grown-up
gobble full of beer. Howeverly, iced drunkerds
perfers beer because of pleased trickle.</p>

<p>I are not permitted to sell it to them thirsts at
Strunsky saloon, because I are not sufficiently intelligent;
so I must rubb glaswares &amp; mop to floor,
also become attentive to Hon. Phonograf which require
68 wind-up with squeek about “Old Contucky
Home” which please G. W. McCann, prominent
Drunk, till he weep because it sound human. I am
seriously worked to keep this job; and yet I am
entirely educational about all intoxicants when
doing so.</p>

<p>“There is some good salooners and some
bad,” say letter-writer to newspaper. I have
sneeked farly &amp; wide with gum-slippers, but am
disabled to find such a bad salooner. Whenever
I speek uply to a salooner for question, “Are
you such a bad salooner?” he answer for reply,
“Ah, no! I are an entirely good kind.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t they no such things as Bad Salooners?”
I ask Hon. Strunsky for queery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>“They <i>are</i> some such,” he say for chased
expression, “but they are horbly difficult to
discover.”</p>

<p>Hon. Strunsky are a very nice variety of Good
Salooner. He acknowledj it himself. G. W.
McCann say Hon. Strunsky have a heart like a
watermelon. I noticed it. It are large, but
often deliciously iced. He are a sweet &amp; liberal
man to all persons what got sufficient cash-money
to pay for it. When the poor calls to the bar of
Strunsky for loan of money he seldom turn them
off with empty grouch. The safe of Hon. Strunsky
is full of watches, stuck-pins, repaired clothing,
deed of house &amp; lott, and other hardware what
the poor has left as security. Them sweet
salooner will never turn deaf eye to want &amp;
misery as long as want &amp; misery will leave month’s
wages at Hon. Bar. A kindy man are Hon.
Strunsky.</p>

<p>This benefacting gentleman believe in keeping
his saloon clean &amp; full of home influences. He
don’t not believe in no rye-bald scenes of debutchery
around place. So when a coal-chuck become
entire paralysis there, Hon. Strunsky remove
remainder of wage from pockets of them unforchnate
man &amp; he are nex discovered in street.
When U. S. marine sailor enjoy stab-cut in this
Strunsky home his remainder are dragged quietly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
to a alley full of shadows so he will not die all
over nice saw-dust floor.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday while Hon. Strunsky was
elsewhere talking about it Hon. G. W. McCann,
prominent drunkerd, come-me sneekretly with
Standard Oil expression and request 1 free drink
as a loving gift.</p>

<p>“Why you deserve such free gift?” is question
for me.</p>

<p>“I are a large tank-line &amp; therefore entitled
to occasional rebates,” he betray.</p>

<p>So I give him considerable goblet of and interview
him for temperance movement.</p>

<p>“Why do men drink alcohol?” are first question
I make.</p>

<p>“Because they can not eat it,” are relapse for
him.</p>

<p>“Do whisky-booz do harmful injry to interior
when took in excess?” I repent.</p>

<p>“Suppose so,” smack he, “59 successive
tumblers are sufficient for a strong man.”</p>

<p>“Are a moderate drunk good for persons?”
next come out.</p>

<p>“O sure of!” he negotiate, “I can feel it doing
so.”</p>

<p>“It are no true joy what leave a dark browny
taste in morning,” I say for David Star Jordan
expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>“It are no true joy in the morning, but it are
a very fine imitation of it the night before,”
commute that sinny drunk.</p>

<p>“Hon. Horce, famous Roman writer, say-how
whisky make poets sing,” is arrival for me.</p>

<p>“Suppose he are right,” say Hon. McCann.
“I have often enjoyed singing in ears by early
morning.”</p>

<p>I make note of this phenomenal.</p>

<p>“All saloons looks alike to me,” regret Hon.
Drunk.</p>

<p>“So sad to hear!” I rake out. “Saloons
is entirely different in appearance. Some is red,
some pink, some plate-glassed by door to look
like National-Bank—how you no tell difference?”</p>

<p>“We cross the bar at different places,” he
report, “but we all come out in the same boat.”</p>

<p>“You regret downly path you took?” I ask it.</p>

<p>“I got no regret, thank you,” he reject. “With
another drink I could beat the world.”</p>

<p>So he go home and beat his wife, as usual.</p>

<p class="tb">In night-time I burst soda-syfen to mirror of
Strunsky saloon, so I decide to be a temperance
Japanese &amp; resign before discovery &amp; kick. So
I go back to my bedstead at Patriots of Japan
Board &amp; Lodging where I find O-Fido who make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
joy-signal to me by snubbed tail. He are merely
a doggly pup who ain’t got no soul to skare with
Demon Rums, etc. He ain’t go no ambition &amp;
are fond of milk. He imagine Hashimura Togo
are Emperor of Japan, I suppose. I permit him
to be decieved.</p>

<p>I remove off my shoes for comfert &amp; took down
book of Rubbert Burn, famous Scotch, for read it.
I study them soft musick about “Flow gentle,
sweet Afton”—and then I think how people
say-so that he were most greatest Poet when most
drunk. Maybe-so he were; but I never seen no
drunks act that way around saloon of Hon.
Strunsky.</p>

<p>When—of suddenly—come rap-tap at door.
And inwards arrive Bunkio Saguchi, fly-away
Japanese, with jaggly expression of one who has.</p>

<p>“I wish to give banzai to entire human race to
include Nick, Zar of Russia, who are merely a
mistake,” gollup Bunkio. “I wish to telegraf
happy greet to all politicians in &amp; out of office to
include Col. Guffey, who——”</p>

<p>He make set-down to floor because he think it
was a chair.</p>

<p>“You are in a toxic condition,” I dib frownly.</p>

<p>“Many persons are most intelligent when so,”
he motter.</p>

<p>“Many persons are least so,” I flap back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span></p>

<p>“General Grant, great leader, enjoyed spells
of drunk,” say Bunkio for argument.</p>

<p>“Alexander the Great enjoyed allepeptick fits,”
I smoke up, “yet every person what takes a spasm
cannot conker new worlds.”</p>

<p>“Many a battles has been won by gin-wine,”
rasp that jaggly boy.</p>

<p>“Battle of Mukden were not,” I dib. “In
them battle Japanese was full of banzai, Russians
was full of vodka. To-morrow when you are
calm some brite Japanese Schoolboy will told you
who won them famous target-practice.”</p>

<p>I put him in my bedstead &amp; tock under covers
for wet towel on brow. Soonly he enjoy tear-drop
of eye &amp; say he was cris-crossed in love;
then he make good-night for eye-brows.</p>

<p>Me &amp; O-Fido go take walk &amp; forget such
scenery. At Oisoya Hotel, Pine St. near Kerney,
I see several Japanese Schoolboys doing a conversation.</p>

<p>“To-night I are a Aunty Saloon Leg,” I say-it
by virtuous chest. “But to-morrow I may feel
better &amp; enjoy slight beer ceremony.”</p>

<p>“Would America be more better without no
saloons?” require Uncle Nichi who was there.</p>

<p>“Perhapsly,” I snuggest. “Hon. Rev. Chillworthy
say, ‘If there was no Drunks there
wouldn’t be no Murders.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>“Occasional Murders makes life briter,”
reflact Cousin Nogi.</p>

<p>“If there was no saloons there would be no
crime,” say Arthur Kickahajama.</p>

<p>“There would also be no fun,” say Sydney
Katsu, jr.</p>

<p>“There would be no poverty,” say Frank the
Japanned Boot-polish.</p>

<p>“There would be no trusts,” say I. Anazuma.</p>

<p>“There would be no enthusiasm,” say Sago
Jokai.</p>

<p>“There would be no insane asylums,” say
Albert Sudekachi.</p>

<p>“There would be no Poets,” say Hashimura
Togo.</p>

<p>If the saloon must go, Mr. Editor, see that it are
put away in some convenient place. I ask it.</p>

<span class="smaller">ELECTION DAY</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, November 1st.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper who have been
frequently nominated to be President by loving
Japanese subscribers; but he must refuse
such jobs, thank you, because too busy with
ink-pen—and he would rather write than
be President.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Mr. Sir</span>—Election Day are now within
short gasp of here &amp; all Japanese Schoolboys
of my acquaintanceship are running back and
forthly. Symptoms of tense patriotism for them.
I. Anazuma, Japanese barber, have pasted in
window-pain of his shave store 2 portraits of fat
&amp; famous Americans. On one portrait he have
wrote following description in Japanese:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">HON. WM. JENNY BRYAN</span><br>
<i>He Will Deliver the Nation out of Peril</i></p>

<p>On other fat portrait he have wrote:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap">HON. WM. H. TAFT</span><br>
<i>He Will Deliver the Goods out of Kindness</i></p>

<p>I were a-standing by sidewalk making eye-glances
at them 2 sweet portraits &amp; choosing which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
to vote for (if Yellow Peril could do so, thank you)
when uply come Arthur Kickahajama with sad-dogged
expression of dizzy heart.</p>

<p>“Hashimura Togo,” he unpack, “why you gaz
at them 2 Presidents with rapture of ears?”</p>

<p>“Soon one will be elected,” I apply, “&amp; then
troubles of this Kingdom will be all over.”</p>

<p>“Over!!” dib Arthur Kickahajama for shreech.
“Over!!!” He make thrills of knuckles which
are sure symbol of allepeptick fits.</p>

<p>Then he drag from interior pocket of coat some
rippings from newspaper-press which he read me
with hearse voice. From <i>Daily Hoot</i>, violently
conservative Republican paper, he read as
following:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘If Bryan are elected ruin will be enjoyed everywheres.
Heaven are expected to fall any minute. Corn will refuse to
grow in Kansas &amp; National Guard will be called out to make
it do so. In South niggers will be darker &amp; more lynched.
Hens will neglect to surrender their eggs. America will be
considerably cursed. Election of Hon. Bryan should be cause
of great national funeral.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“So glad to hear this in time,” I riggle. “Therefore
I shall vote for Hon. Taft if I could.”</p>

<p>Arthur for glum read following editorial from
<i>Daily Riot</i>, seriously Democratick hand-organ:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘If Taft are elected America will quit. Common People
will be scrunched by drowntroddery. Truth will also receive
hourly chops by ax. Kings will appear everywheres riding in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
automobiles. Daily excursions to Siberia will be enjoyed by
masses. Groans. Right of free speeches will be denied to
Henry Watterson &amp; bloodshed must therefore ensue. Patriots
will grunt with deranged hair. Election of Hon. Taft should
be cause of great national mourning,’”</p>

</div>

<p>“So sad!” say Arthur, “America must therefore
go to complete doggly smitthrine on date of
Nov. 3.”</p>

<p>“Are they no way to escape this?” I alarm with
face.</p>

<p>“Only one,” commute Arthur. “Perhapsly
Bluejean V. Debs might be elected by mistake.”</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, I go way from Arthur full of damp
thoughts about Election Day. I go to grassy yard
of Mrs. Lusy Macdonald, 286 pounds complete
gentleness, and there I work my job assisting
shrubbage to grow for $1.25 weekly payment. My
dog O-Fido company me there &amp; are entirely useless,
as usual. While I are to work soothing her
lawn with rakes I are continually thinking for
selfish brain: “If I merely had 1 day lie-off from
work I might do something to save America.” So
I wish I could &amp; O-Fido agree with snubbed tail.</p>

<p>Soonly come Mrs. Lusy Macdonald in dainty
pink rapper which look like 3 queens. Angelick
expressions for her.</p>

<p>“Togo,” she say-it, “have you got a ill to look
so languish?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span></p>

<p>“O! sweethearted Mrs. Madam, I enjoy a brainache
this morning, thank you,” are complain from
me. “Could I not obtain a lie-off from Work,
thanks so much, please?”</p>

<p>“Why so you require such a lie-off?” are burst
from her.</p>

<p>“With sufficient leisure I might save America,”
I mention.</p>

<p>“Such worthy thought!” she relish. “Therefore
you are permitted 1 day lie-off from rakish labours
on lawn.”</p>

<p>I make back-away with humbel bows. O-Fido
do somewhat simlar. When we arrive to gate-post
Mrs. Lusy Macdonald exclaim for sweetness:</p>

<p>“How you shall spent this day of idle enjoyment,
please?”</p>

<p>“I shall spent it in worrying about the ruin of
America which should occur on Nov. 3,” are fuss
I make &amp; do a vanish. O-Fido do same way.</p>

<p>So I go to street corner &amp; set on water-plog to
enjoy sorrow without interrupt. O-Fido devote
time smelling rats which is not there under
pavement.</p>

<p>Near off by lamp-post I see several carpenter-mans
at work in middle of street a-building 1 tiny
house of delicious sheet-iron. It were a awful
temporary-looking struxure of 6 × 10 architexure.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly long come one Hon. Police, by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
name Paul Smutz, who get my affection by arrest
of Bunkio Saguchi for gin-drunk. I are a proud
acquaintanceship to this hero.</p>

<p>“Such oddy house!” I say-it with points to place
what them carpenter-mans was a-building.
“What you call such a cabin in American
language?”</p>

<p>“That house,” say Hon. Police, “are called a
Pole.”</p>

<p>“It do not look like a Pole in appearance,”
I otter. “To Japanese Schoolboy it look more
like a penitentiary for white rabbits.”</p>

<p>“So wicked thought!” say Hon. Police with
buttons. “That tiny house to which you now
look at are Palladium of American Liberty.”</p>

<p>“What do Americans do in such a Palladium?”
are next question for me.</p>

<p>“They votes for Presidents,” ollicute Hon.
Smutz with helmet.</p>

<p>“So happy!” I say-it. “In them tiny doll-cabins
Presidents is manufactured by ballet-box
every 4 years! Were Pres. Roosevelt made in a
little tin cottage like that?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely similar,” snuggest that coply man.</p>

<p>“I are surprised he did not burst it!” are notation
for me.</p>

<p>Silences by Hon. Police. Waggish signals by
O-Fido.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span></p>

<p>“How could Hon. Taft be accommodated in
such a toy temple?” are intelligent query I make.</p>

<p>“Fat candidates gets slim votes in some
districts,” complain he.</p>

<p>“What makes Americans more freer than any
other kingdom?” I ask-it because Hon. Smutz
are not yet savage.</p>

<p>“Americans is more freer because they are
permitted to vote,” compute them official.</p>

<p>“So happy Americans!” I snagger. “How
free they should all feel going to Pole on Nov. 3
eech with a ballet in his hand to vote it!”</p>

<p>“They should, but do they?” revoke he with
club. “Many Americans make long journeys
on Election Day to escape that Palladium of
Liberty.”</p>

<p>“Could they feel free without that sweet
privelage?” I require.</p>

<p>“They feel most free when they forget it,” he
dub. “I prove this by following tabloid statistick:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“1—Out of eech 3 Americans only 1 Registers.</p>

<p>“2—Out of eech 3 who Registers only 1 Votes.</p>

<p>“3—Out of eech 3 who Votes only 1 cares who is Elected.”</p>

</div>

<p>“How shocky!” I gasp. “By such sinful
statistick America must be going to doggly bow-wow!”
(Howels from O-Fido.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span></p>

<p>“Can not some patriots do something to make
more votes for Election Day?” are next queery I
ask.</p>

<p>“Many of them do,” say he. “Many persons
votes 5 or 6 times eech election to make fatter
ballet-box.”</p>

<p>“Such noble patriots should receive at least 1
Carnegie meddle,” I lapse.</p>

<p>“They should, but do they?” are repose he say.
“There will be much gladness of rejoicing shot
off in this Hon. City for Election Night,” he add
for information.</p>

<p>“I read by newspaper this morning how Election
of either Candidates would be cause for great
national mourning,” I reckon.</p>

<p>“You read the wrong paper,” say Hon. Smutz.
“When announcement of new President are made
entire lid will be removed from America &amp; 4th of
July will shoot through. What patriots are not
already in saloons will be tied together in magnificent
blockade on streets mixed with brass bands,
tin-horning, full dinner-pails, Glad-It’s-Over
Marching Clubs, automobile axidents &amp; other
demonstrations of peaceful banzai. Musick-waggons
will ocasionally sonter by with all office-seekers
trying to get on at once. Maddy yalls
from crowd when eech newspaper bulletin-board
announce that another doubtful State has gone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
Republickan, as usual. Rockets. Occasional
fights to make everybody completely cheerful.
Fire-engines go by to some joyful blaze. Telegrams
arrive. Romp-girls dance along with tickle
feathers. Then O!! Portrait of Future President
are flashy to screen. Bells go off confused by
whissles &amp; drumcore exploded by throats of
1,000,000 yalling Americans.”</p>

<p>“And what next?” I enquire patiently.</p>

<p>“Following this,” say Hon. Paul Smutz, heroic
Police, “following this are complete silence for
4 years.”</p>

<p>And he depart off to catch an excessive automobile
what done a crime.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, it will require more than explosions
to awake Hon. Washington from sweet sleep
which will go on for next 4 years. When Associated
Press hears slight shock along Patomac it
will not be sounds of unrest—it will be merely
snores from happy Congressmen. By time this
loving letter are there in your post-office, White
House furniture are already preparing to be sat
on by another kind of Person. Perhapsly he will
be a bigger man, but I bet my bootware he will not
cover so many places at once. In Executive
Offices a new Voice will kind of quiver &amp; flitter
through corridors which is used to being cracked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span>
by a Real Racket. In Aunty Room outside will
set distinguished statesmans in awful neat rows
with eyebrows full of Thought and nothing else.
Gentleman inside may say, “Prevaricatorius ugly
lyre!” now &amp; then, but sound of this curse will be
less hearty than of yore-time.</p>

<p>And in that Crowd Outside following sweet
faces will be missing:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—Shaggy Pete, Louisiana guide.</p>

<p>2—Harvard football captain.</p>

<p>3—Mrs. O’Rafferty, mother of 6 twins.</p>

<p>4—Rev. Lyman Abbott.</p>

<p>5—Spike McGhoul, heavyweight swat.</p>

<p>6—Charles Scribbler &amp; Sons.</p>

<p>7—Duke De Buzzi and staff.</p>

<p>8—Nero, famous trick elephant from Hippodrome.</p>

</div>

<p>Them features, Mr. Editor, will be seriously
lacking. Cabinet will come together occasionally
for slight confap but it will seem quiet, like
directors’ meeting of Ice Trust. Treaties will be
made in sneeky gum-slipper manner. Panama
Canal will be finished &amp; nobody will know it.
New President of America might declare war
between U. S. and Germany with less dramatick
effect than Hon. Roosevelt got by chasing 3 boys
off from White House steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<p>Next 4 years will be healthy climbate for old
persons &amp; delicate children. People will live
longer but not so much. And what will happen
to us in 1912? Hon. Nick Longworth will explain
with American eye-wink!</p>

calm Derby Hat to make himself sensible in
order to do so.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>—If my Uncle Nichi would not go
roundy town seeing America he would not come
home &amp; talk about it. I should like to remain his
affactunate Nefew, I should delight to reverence
his bald hairs because he are my Ancester—but
I will be lynched if I can remain faithful to all
them fooly Questions he ask-it! Eech moment
by clock-time he come to me with Queery &amp;
when I are giving sweethearted reply he are preparing
another Enquire for answer. Only a
mean dib can plug his voice, thank you!</p>

<p>“I observe something,” he say-me yesterday
because he think he did, “I observe it how female
women of America is entirely beasts of burden.”</p>

<p>“That are something to observe,” I deploy.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
“Where they carry them beastly burden, please,
if proper?”</p>

<p>“I observe it,” he remain, “how they carries
them burdens in enormed &amp; sometimes overbearing
quantities on top of their heads. Oftenly
ladies of minus 126 pounds of complete frailness
is seen totering from walk to walk with awful
monstry platforms on their skull while on top side
of this are piled fruits &amp; vegetables, glassware,
window-curtains, fuel, iron &amp; wood, office supplies,
general groceries, flours &amp; other provisions.
What you call them platters full of merchandise?”
require Nichi.</p>

<p>“Would you get amazed if told?” I ask it.</p>

<p>“I shall attempt to,” he report.</p>

<p>“Them platters,” I say slow for gentle break,
“is called Hats!”</p>

<p>Uncle Nichi is staggered to believe it.</p>

<p>“In Japan,” he tangle, “they would be called
roofs. Such a Hat are sifficiently sized to support
a entire family.”</p>

<p>“In America,” I falter, “it oftenly require a
entire family to support such a Hat.”</p>

<p>Uncle Nichi set down because he are a oldy
man and got a faint nerve.</p>

<p>“I will told you more,” I revoke. “Those
Hon. Hats is pinned on to them Ladies what forget
how painful they feel &amp; drag them from places<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
to places with smile of sweet resign. They are
even happy while wearing them because they
Imagines something.”</p>

<p>“What could they Imagine after that?” are
enqueery for Nichi.</p>

<p>“They Imagines they are beautiful!” are
report from me.</p>

<p>“Hashimura Togo,” rasp them feebly Unc,
“up to now I have believed everything. Please
tell lies more gently. I are not prepared to
swallow too much.”</p>

<p>“When foreigners talk about American Ladies
they must be prepare to swallow anything,” are
argue I make. “This are customary.”</p>

<p>“Ladies must be oftenly scrushed to death
beneath them awful lids,” require Nichi with
Hearst editorial look.</p>

<p>“Such are the untruth,” I let go. “Them
Hats is frequently more lighter than they looks
by appearance. Although they are huje enormalosities
amassed all over outside with riotous
debree, yet they are kept light by fact that there
ain’t nothing inside of them.”</p>

<p>“What-so!” say Nichi. “Ain’t them Ladies
got their brains inside of them Hats?”</p>

<p>“If Ladies had sifficient brains enough to fill
such Hats they would wear them much smaller,”
are jount from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<p>“Can we expect something worse soon?”
suppose Nichi.</p>

<p>“Of surely we can!” say me. “In <i>Woman’s
Homely Companion</i>, stylish paper, I read 1 page
of fashionable hints wrote by a elderly clergyman
who sign himself ‘Frou-Frou’ because he need the
salary. He make following alarmy prediction:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘Stiles for 1909 will be built on Delagrange models with
box-kite planes fore and aft to look awful tasty. All them
patterns for winter wear will be heavier-than-air types which
is very chick. Them Zepellin hats, so popular last season,
are now being frowned at by Dam Fashion who says they are
clumbsy &amp; apt to catch afire. Them new hats will seem kind
of horble when first looked at, but when they got a fan-shaped
propeller going at full speed in the rear, you got to acknowledge
they look mischievous &amp; expensive.</p>

<p>“‘Many poor girls is making them at home after Buttermilk
Patterns furnished by request &amp; 10c extra please. Some
light ashwood ribs, 90 yards mercyfied silk &amp; a trifle of wire
(which can be took out of any piano) are sifficient for.</p>

<p>“‘By sending $7,000 to Paris you can get one of them
ready-trimmed by the Wright Sisters.’”</p>

</div>

<p>“If it was not printed in that <i>Homely Companion</i>
paper I would enjoy a suspicion that Hon.
Frou-Frou was talking about airships,” contract
my poor Relation.</p>

<p>“Where would they be carried away to?” ask
Uncle Nichi, who are studying American jokes
by correspondence school.</p>

<p>“To any extreme,” I choke off for fear I shall
hit Uncle Nichi with a angry Dib. So he go way
for read newspaper &amp; learn some more intelligent
Questions to ask it.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, it are fashionable to appear smarty
&amp; suspicious when conversing in print about
Ladies. Any colledge child not intelligent enough
to learn bookkeeping &amp; stenography can publish
at least 1 book called “Sneery Thoughts of a
Snappy Cynick” &amp; sell from 10 to 1,000,000
copies. This to include several epigrams about
Mrs. Eve and other famous Parisians. (“What
are a ‘epigram’?” ask Little Annie Anazuma.</p>

<p>“A epigram are a cheap Joke in a dress-suit,”
are reply for Japanese Schoolboy.)</p>

<p>Even Hon. Rud. Kipling, who write many
novels and speak fluidly in both English &amp;
American, make sinickal talk about female Ladies.
He-say “A Woman are merely a Woman, but a
good cigar cost 25c.”</p>

<p>In Manila a good cigar only cost 8c, and yet
Ladies is found growing there in tropickal
bundance. So you see it are useless to try &amp; compute
the worthlessness of them in terms of tobacco.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Editor, I know only 3 Ladies to my acquaintanceship;
but there is a 4th one now which I am
learning pretty quick. Among this crowd are
Hon. Mrs. Lusy Macdonald, 286 pounds of entire
beauty, to her I enjoy a tender business relation.
She reward me $1.25 weekly for barber her lawn
&amp; comb it with rakes. Oftenly I speak to this
lady with pathetick expression, because she may
rise my salary if I look sifficiently unhappy.
Sometime she bring me tea by side-porch to
include ginger-snaps &amp; I tell her delicious lies
about myself so she will think what a fine Jobber
I am.</p>

<p>This Lady are very expensive in clothes which
appear hellish &amp; also include dimonds. She
obtain her gownds in Paris where they hates
Americans and shows it by the stiles they sell them.
It are a mean revenge. But Mrs. Macdonald can
afford to dress in stile, because she are rich enough
to be exentrick. I do not yet notice that she wear
Directory skirt at knee. I shall telegraf you if
she gets one.</p>

<p>Next in my acquaintanceship of feminines
are Little Annie Anazuma, 9-year-age daughter
of I. Anazuma, Japanese barber. This childy
Japanese are too young to be a lady, but she are
already quite foolish.</p>

<p>&amp; 3rd on this List of Ladies are Miss Alice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
Furioki, wife to my Cousin Nogi. I was once her
finance, but when she marry Nogi I broke my
engagement to her for spiteful reasons.</p>

<p>But 4th of them are a Girly Person to which
I must own up. She are by initials Miss Evelyn
Suki &amp; have become a dear schoolfriend to Miss
Furioki and very oftenly they meet together to
do some chumming &amp; other giggles. And very
oftenly I make drop-in to home of Cousin Nogi
for borrow opera glass or cigarette or what he got.
And oftenly Miss Suki make door-knock for see
Miss Furioki &amp; Japanese Boy are axidentally
there. I make eye-wink of soul to think how
fox I are.</p>

<p>By last Wednesday <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> I get nervus about
Cousin Nogi &amp; go see him offhandedly. Miss
Furioki come to door and I make very humbel
signals to her with derby hat.</p>

<p>“I am delicious to ask it, please, Mrs. Madam,
thank you so much, so sorry I come. Are Cousin
Nogi inside, thank you?”</p>

<p>“No, he are entirely out!” dib Miss Furioki,
who despises me earnestly.</p>

<p>“Then I shall remain, thank you,” I say for
cheerful smiles &amp; take set-down to parler where
I see Miss Suki doing a fancy task in companionship
with Miss Furioki. On centre-table was
a large objeck to resemble a clothes-basket &amp;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
them Ladies was fondly trimbing it with smilax,
ribbons and other laces. Occasionally they stand
off-side, mouths confused by pins; sometimes they
make critick faces and speek in milinary language.</p>

<p>“What you call That what you are doing?” I
wander.</p>

<p>“Intelligent persons calls it a Hat,” snip Miss
Furioki.</p>

<p>“By Bible you could not wore such a Hat,”
are mope from me.</p>

<p>“What-say Bible about it?” require Miss
Suki who are studying to be a missionary.</p>

<p>“Hon. Bible say, ‘Do not hide your light under
a bushel basket,’” are all sound I make.</p>

<p>Deep breathing from Miss Furioki. Miss
Suki look slyly joyful. Pretty soonly them Hat are
sifficiently complete for have try-on to head of
Miss Furioki, who make poze before mirror with
cowcattish expression.</p>

<p>“You hide cozily inside,” I arrange.</p>

<p>“It are a very theatrical hat,” lapse Miss
Suki fairly.</p>

<p>“It look like a famous Play to me,” I commune
for pious regard.</p>

<p>“What famous Play you meant?” queery Miss
Alice. “You meant the ‘Jolly Widow?’”</p>

<p>“Maybe ‘Payed in Full’ are Play them Hat
look like,” beseech Miss Suki.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p>“Ah, no!” I revolve, “another from them!”</p>

<p>“Then which play it look like, if so smart?”
rasp wife of Nogi.</p>

<p>“It look like ‘The Devil’ to me,” I assassinate,
and go out by door. Sound of crashy furniture
inside, and other simptoms of an American Girl.
Also some delicious snickkers from Miss Suki.
Thank her so many!</p>

<p class="tb">Foreigners visiting America for first time is
expected to say something about American women
before getting off the boat. A very sublime Prince
from Island of Borneo of recently come over &amp;
say following statistick about American Women:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—They are naturally very foolish, but are
less so when educated.</p>

<p>2—It are easy to distinguish their Sext by their
clothes—</p>

<p>3—Except in the case of Literary Ladies who
wears derbies.</p>

<p>4—They are awful extravagant.</p>

<p>5—They are terrible stingy.</p>

<p>6—Many of them has more snippy espree than
Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>7—Many has less.</p>

<p>8—They have got such quantity of Charm, etc.,
that it are difficult for a Foreigner to look at
them without enjoying Lovesick simptoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span></p>

<p>American Ladies hear them compliments, Mr.

but they are forgetful that what that Hon. Sublime
said about them are true of every national
Lady in the entire world—with the exception
of the Ladies of Zeeweezi Land where it are the
custom for them to cut off their noses to spite their

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, November 10th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To Editor New York Newspaper which must give
large Colledge Yall to see such great Yale-Harvard
feetball combination when Hon.
Roosevelt pushed Hon. Taft across line.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hon. Mr.</span>—I have discovered more yet.
America are no sooner through making one Loud
Noise than she are prepared to make another.
Her screems for Spring occupy Baseballing; next
come Presidential Election where every person
are ready to banzai &amp; make provoked hollers;
soonly following this arrive Feetball when talented
Colledge Ladds is glued together for chorus of
howels &amp; rores which you would not believe
except when it happens. Then America gives
Thanksgiving because they are glad it are all
over; but so vainly to think! With immediate
quickness arrive Happy New Years when the roof
of Hon. Heaven are entirely shrieked away with
steam whissles. After this who knows what?</p>

<p>“You have forgot to put in Fourth of July,” say
Uncle Nichi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span></p>

<p>“That Hon. Explosion must be mentioned all
by itself,” are contort for me.</p>

<p>Mr. Editor, all newspaper-prints is now filled
with scandal about feet-ballers &amp; what happen to
them. I understand how Carlyle Indians would
be champions of America except for fact that Chief
Kick-in-the-Head have received something like
his name; also ½ back, Hon. Hoopi, have fraxured
both legs; ¼ back, Crazy Buffalo, are now in
hospital enjoying 2 or 3 ribs, &amp; Young-Man-Who-Butts-Like-a-Goat,
famous tackler, have
come apart &amp; must be sewed together. White
mans has been entirely unjust to Indians. Not
satisfied with teaching them whisky-drunk
they now educates them in feetball. The
Nobel Red Man are thusly fast becoming a
bursted race.</p>

<p>In another news-print I read-it how there are
a general move in America to make feetball
more kindly. How foolish to think! Feetball
without an occasional murder would be like a
bullfite without no Hon. Bull. It would be
gentle, but who would come? I require no
answer.</p>

<p>Howeverly all grandest California Colledges
is now playing Rugboy feetball which is English
&amp; therefore entirely polite. And yet necks can
be bursted by this way if required.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span></p>

<p>Last Saturday in early <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span> I make a very
stylish appearance to my clothes which include
frockaway coat, derby hat, respectful
gloves &amp; whatever shoes &amp; socks are necessary
for most beautiful way to look. With
such ornaments I could not wear my familiar
necktie which are getting too shabbed; so I
borrow one of angry red complexion from
Arthur Kickahajama who was not there when
I took it. Thank you, Arthur, for kindness
loan!</p>

<p>With them fashionable haberdash I make my
joyful footprints go in direction of sidewalk
where all Japanese what see me revoke, “Where
would Hashimura Togo go so completely decorated?”
But for answer I make American eye-wink
&amp; nothing else.</p>

<p>Pretty soonly I arrive by door-mat of Yoshima
Suki, Japanese carpenter, &amp; there I do rap-tap
with nervus knuckles. After deliciously long
time Miss Evelyn Suki, dreamy lady of entire
youngness, come to knob &amp; look surprised because
she expect it was me.</p>

<p>“Kind morning, Mr. Togo,” she say-it with
deceptive expression of a female, “which of my
Parents did you come to see?”</p>

<p>“How many of them Parents have you got,
please?” I remove with polite derby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span></p>

<p>“I got two to include 1 Mother &amp; 1 Father, both
enjoying nice health,” she response.</p>

<p>“You are fortunate to have so many,” I
corrode, “therefore permit them to enjoy their
nice health without disturb from us.”</p>

<p>She do so, thank you.</p>

<p>We set in parlour &amp; have a few conversations
&amp; occasional topicks. I get more charms eech
moment by her sweet looks &amp; cowcattish smile.
I could throb forever in such lonesome company.
Pretty soonly I say-so.</p>

<p>“Hon. Miss Suki, excuse me, sir, I ask it”
(such nerves from me!). “Please may we go
forthly together this afternoon for some sporty
amusement?”</p>

<p>“Where we go to find such a sporty amusement?”
she dement, tucking away her hair with
morsel wave.</p>

<p>“In Japanese Y. M. C. A.,” I snagger, “Hon.
Rev. Chillworthy will speek an entirely harmless
lecture about ‘Onward &amp; Upward for Little
Missionaries,’ We could go there for minus
expense because it are free.”</p>

<p>Stillness from Miss Suki.</p>

<p>“You no care for such an excitements?” I
ask it.</p>

<p>“Slightly, perhaps,” are response from her,
“Where else could we go for it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span></p>

<p>(I make sneekret count inside my pocket which
contain 45c wealth.)</p>

<p>“Trolley-ride to Cliff House &amp; peanuts by
beach would be somewhat fashionable amusement
if it wasn’t raining,” I snuggest.</p>

<p>“It might, but would it?” are next question
for her.</p>

<p>I begin to enjoy go-home feeling for such discouredged
talk.</p>

<p>“To tell you truthly, Mr. Togo,” she apply,
“I got 2 tickets for one Feetball Game which will
be kicked off this afternoon. You like to be
chaperone to me for this ceremony?”</p>

<p>“I am reckless to try,” I cheer up. (For only
a very fooly person would omit to be chaperone to
a Angel what got 2 tickets, price $4.)</p>

<p>So we go there &amp; seen what was.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> Mr. Togo is describing Intercollegiate Football; still played by minor
colleges in California. Rugby is being played by the principal colleges
there.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, with what crippled penmanship
I got how should I attemp to describe such scene
of banzai, hari-kiri, stroggle &amp; push what we
seen for them 2 tickets? How can poor Japanese
Schoolboy tell of such delicious race-riot all over
mud which them heroes plowed with their faces?</p>

<p>Therefore I shall do so.</p>

<p>Me &amp; Miss Evelyn Suki we set on bleached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
seats between 6 maiden co-eds and 2 colledge
boys of average age 63 years. Heart-bursting
screems was enjoyed by them for entire afternoon.
When most fiercest play of feetball happened
them oldy colledge boys would strike me in ankle
with their cane which was a insult. Rainy
weather &amp; slight westerly showers.</p>

<p>Game of Feetball, Mr. Editor, are played by
22 enormous boys which are divided equally into
½ to look even. One ½ wear stripes &amp; other ½
wears New Jersey sweaters of entirely blue colour.
None of them Players is allowed to be killed before
the game begins.</p>

<p>Delicious mud all over grounds which are good
to slide on &amp; show how graceful it can be done.</p>

<p>Considerable rah-rah cries indulged in by all
specktaters to include Miss Suki &amp; 10,000 others.
Talented howels from all colledge boys who set
in bleached seats around feetball grounds which
is called a Griddle because it look like something
else. Of suddenly OH-H-H-H!!!</p>

<p>To middle of griddle with brave runsteps come
11 striped athletes followed by 11 blue youths.
More rores. In centre of Griddle Hon. Feetball
(which resemble a leather melon) are placed down.
Whissle from Foreman &amp; suddenly one blue
youth rosh forwards &amp; give them Hon. Ball
one very brutal kick which send it to Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
where it intend to go. Splandid rushing together
by all youths which do knock-downs with rage.
Hon. Ball, when he make come-down, are lovingly
embraced by a striped youth, but one blue youth
see him &amp; get jalous, so he throw him to mud
with deathly thump. Eech member of both
teams are now permitted to jump on this young
man when he are laying pronely. Then Hon.
Foreman holler “Down!” &amp; all are sure of it.</p>

<p>Next Player to arrive are Hon. Doctor who do
a hospital corps and remove 3 players with limps.
Banzais from all. Game then go on for all afternoon
by following rotation:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1—Savage ball-kick.</p>

<p>2—Wildly rush together.</p>

<p>3—Delicious throw-down.</p>

<p>4—Everybody jump-on.</p>

<p>5—All get off, if possible.</p>

<p>6—Doctors collect broken boys.</p>

<p>7—More ball-kick, more banzai, etc., till twilight.</p>

</div>

<p>Pretty soonly when 1 colledge player of striped
appearance make grab-up of ball, blue colledge
boys forget to knock him down; so with them pigly
sphere clasp dearly in arms he make hurrysteps
across field; and them blue players get very angry,
so they chase him with fierce hair. How useless!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
Soonly he carry that ball behind goal-sticks &amp;
Blue Colledge cry, “Shah!” while Striped Colledge
cry, “Rah!”</p>

<p>“Oh!! that count 5 for our side,” say elderly
youth next by me.</p>

<p>“Why it count 5 when only 2 players was
killed?” was question I ask-it; but that antique
child was too busy with banzais for answer.</p>

<p>So I took away Miss Suki for ice-cream soda
ceremony, price 20c., where we could be more
lonesome together.</p>

<p>“It must require great strength to kill so many
people in an afternoon,” she say-it with sweet
sips.</p>

<p>“With a ax I could do much better,” are reply
I make.</p>

<p class="tb">This week my chumb, Sydney Katsu, Jr., who
went to Harvard for study mollycuddling, come
back here enjoying great damages. I could see
by the expression of his legs how much they was
broke; also bandaged elbows indicate smashy condition
&amp; his brain was held together with a towel.
Most of his teeth he was carrying in his pocket.</p>

<p>“O Sydney!” I report, “who done you all them
delicious injuries you got?”</p>

<p>“Them Mollycuddles done it, thank you!” he
dib, pointing to draped eye which was minus.</p>

<p>“What must a person do to become a Mollycuddle?”
are next review I make.</p>

<p>“He must first go to Harvard &amp; play on
scrubbed Freshman team,” explan Sydney.
“Some mollycuddlish person will say ‘6—11—44’
and toss him a entire feetball. Soonly all Harvard
are on top of him to include the Library Building
&amp; Germanic Museum. Groans from this youth
who are trying to play that game. Finally brickage
are removed from him and he are permitted
to be carried away. If he lives he are a Mollycuddle.”</p>

<p>“Shall you return to study gentle ways of efeet
East?” I announce.</p>

<p>“Ah, no,” corrugate Sydney. “Wildy West
are more peaceful place to be. I shall follow
advice of Hon. Roosevelt which say, ‘Don’t be a
Mollycuddle.’”</p>

<p>So I leave Sydney resting in arnica.</p>

<p>“He-say, ‘United we stand, divided Sue Falls,’”
are smart quotation for Nogi.</p>

<p>“How you obtain such divorce in sweet old

<p>“Maybe you can imagine it,” say Nogi.
“Imagine, please, that Miss Alice Furioki, who
is my wife, got peeved to me because of my
slouched ways &amp; feeble mind.”</p>

<p>I do so easily.</p>

<p>“Imagine, please, I say to her, ‘Fare-bye

<p>“Where you obtain sufficient cash for such a

dearly. I enquire of one Hon. Police who stood
by, ‘Why does them Americans talk together so
corjul?’</p>

<p>“‘It are a family reunion,’ collapse Hon. Police.
‘All of them persons is related to each other
in some way &amp; another—some by proxy, some
by regret; husbands twice removed is talking to
outlaws-in-law. Them tall gentleman with ottomobile
glasses is Senator Guff. Lady he are
talking with are his forgotten wife, now Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
Billings, who will marry Captain Swift, her chaperone,
when both are freed from hated trammels
they now endures.’</p>

<p>“‘On what grounds of domestick grief will they
obtain their divorces on?’ are next for me.</p>

<p>“‘For $5,’ say Hon. Police who has been in Sue
Falls for long time, ‘for $5 you can take your choice
of following grounds:</p>

<p>“‘Failure to provide witty conversation.</p>

<p>“‘Baldness.</p>

<p>“‘Coming home chronic late from Lodge,
such as Elks, Y. M. C. A., etc.</p>

<p>“‘Not coming home from them places.</p>

<p>“‘Habit of cracking nuckles.</p>

<p>“‘Being impolite to ladies.</p>

<p>“‘Being too polite to ladies.</p>

<p>“‘Expressing grief by snores while asleep.</p>

<p>“‘Reading Sunday <i>Journal</i> &amp; believing it.</p>

<p>“‘Warts.</p>

<p>“‘Any slight excuse you may think up while
waiting.’</p>

<p>“‘Thank you so plenty!’ I say to Hon. Police
and go home by return ticket.”</p>

<p>“You go home without them Divorce?” I
say for disappointed quivers.</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” nibble Nogi. “It are useless
luxury for poor Japanese to afford it. I could
buy one slight divorce, but what then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span></p>

<p>“That habit are like drunking,” I approximate.</p>

<p>“Of surely it are!” influence my Cousin.
“First drink are innocent pleasure, but it lead
to more of and continued. First divorce are
harmless amusement, next two or three are only
slight damage to young man—but after that it are
apt to become a fixed habit, and who knows what?”</p>

<p>So Nogi borrow my collar-button &amp; go off
for righteous Sunday walk with his wife, Miss Alice
Furioki.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, I am reminded of a mothological
legend. In awful pre-historick date of Japan
famous poeter, Obi Obi, were a-wandering
through crying-willow grove endeavouring to try
&amp; think up a good poem to write for a magazine.
While full of ponders of suddenly he seen a Willy
Sparrow dancing mongst twiggly branches like
he was suffering from huj jokes. Often &amp; at
times them maudly bird laugh “Ha-ha!” and do
a kick &amp; six comick capers. So Obi Obi, famous
poeter, he tune his Japanese Jews harp and
enquire with rimes:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dilly-darrow, Willy Sparrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Why you do such dance &amp; caper</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a crazy piece of paper,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chirping, cheeping, shrieking, peeping</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With a piggly motion giggly</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p>And that dafty Willy Sparrow, who also had
a talent, make laughing tear-drop &amp; reply:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Tabby-toby, Obi Obi,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Thus I flutter, flatter, caper</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Since my Wife I did escape her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From her scratching feather-snatching—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hence my piggly anticks wiggly</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On this wriggly willow twiggly.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Obi Obi, who are notorious to this day for his
book full of morals, were shocked talkless by rye-bald
remarks of them horid Willy Bird, so he flop
hands to heaven &amp; decry:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Wirro-warro, Willy Sparrow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Baddy birdie what has flirted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Eggs neglected, Wife deserted</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With your cheeping, shrieking, peeping—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Birds of feather winds should weather,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Live together whither-whether.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So this wise Obi Obi he make one delicious
figger-4 trap &amp; he fill it up with olives and other
lunch. Pretty soonly that fooly Willy Sparrow
make hop-down to food—and <i>snap!</i> Catch for
him. Then very briefly after this Mrs. Willy
Sparrow, who was hungry &amp; peeved about non-support,
<i>she</i> make hop-down to trap—and
<i>snap!</i> Catch for her.</p>

<p>So wise Obi Obi he gather them two birds &amp;
he put them in goldy cage together with 2 childish
eggs of which they was parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p>“Ha-ho!” he say musely (for he were a poet).
“It are pleasant to think how I has united them
quarrly fowels into love-companionship.”</p>

<p>So he hang that goldy cage in front of his
Poetry-Shop &amp; invite the entire World to come
&amp; see them Willy Birds enjoying happiness.
And all the entire World come that very afternoon
to observe this Peace Conference.</p>

<p>But alast! When Hon. World looked it seen
Mrs. Willy Bird chewing off ear of her husband
with talented claws. Rawcuss screams. Feathers.
Applause from World which always enjoy fites.
Pretty soonly that Happy Cupple retire to opp.
corners of cage, do some glares &amp; make following
song with voice of tough eagles:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yarrow-yarrow! nasty Sparrow!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ruffled feathers, noises frightful!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Always doing something spiteful.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Chirping, cheeping, shrieking, peeping,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Cacklin’, kickin’, peckin’, pickin’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like a silly stricken chicken!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And when the entire World seen them antick
they stopped their ears &amp; say:</p>

<p>“Perhapsly Hon. Obi Obi <i>do</i> call this Doomestick
Harmony; but it sound to us like the musick
of hand-saws playing on rusty hinges.”</p>

<p>So they retire away. And next morning when
Obi Obi go-see Hon. Cage, what he find there?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
6 feathers &amp; 2 claws which was still disputing
with eech other. All the rest of them Sparrow
Family had disagreed till they were entirely minus.
Except them infant eggs which was broke.</p>

<p>So Obi Obi write following epitaph &amp; sell it to
a second-hand book-store:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Hilly-harrows, silly Sparrows!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When a Poet tried to fix it</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Little birds enjoying jawing</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Perish thus enjoying clawing.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If Obi Obi, the wisest Japanese for 1,007 years,
could not make 2 little Willy Sparrows happy
by locking them together, how can Governments
&amp; Laws be more successful with people who are
bigger &amp; more foolish? Peace Makers is often
proud because they brings Man &amp; Wife together
after quarrels. So sad to think! When Man
&amp; Wife have combattable tempers it do not take
great talent to get them together; but as soon as
they resume talking it often require entire State
Militia to drag them apart.</p>

<p>Will law what bolish Divorces wipe out household
unhappiness? I shall vote for it, if so-do.
Maybe it will make drunken gentlemen sober
&amp; lazy gentlemen reliabilious employees for
more salary. Perhapsly fooly ladies will begin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
study of intelligence, flirtating will cease &amp; all
dull children will go ahead of class. Mischief will
be neglected by old &amp; young.</p>

<p>Maybe, if Divorces is forbid, girls what marries
for money will find sentiment &amp; girls what marry
for sentiment will find money. Maybe tired
husbands will aid sick wives in dish-wash; maybe
plumbers will stay home nights; maybe soft
answers will turn away flatirons. Maybe everybody
will own a ottomobile.</p>

<p>&amp; maybe they won’t.</p>

<p>If Jo-Uncle Cannon would pass some nice
law what would keep persons from <i>wanting</i> to
get divorced this would be very good-healthy
for all races, including Chinese, who are human
in many respects. In England where Divorce are
most difficult to obtain wife-beating are most
deliciously common.</p>

<p>I ask something. Can U. S. Government put
happy glow &amp; family affection into a house where
it ain’t? When Hon. Love flies out of window
can he be pinched by Police before escape?</p>

<p>I require no answer.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HON. MARY CHRISTMAS</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, Dec. 12th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>Your Highness Mr Editor which know everything,
or know where to look for it.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Gentleman</span>—I give you the Hon.
Mary Christmas and hope you will finish it.
Tell me to know, Mr. Sir, what is so important
about this festival that Americans make such
holly-day blow-up of it? “Christmas arrive but
once annually,” many persons explain, making
handshake. Is this peculiar to Christmas? Do
not all other dates arrive annually also? Then
why such happen on Dec. 25 as do? I ask to
enquire.</p>

<p>I answer it, thank you. The Hon. Christmas
is a great give-away festival for all persons of white
extraction. Negroes is permitted in this Christmas
custom, because negroes is always present when
something is being given away. But Japanese
can not be Christmas persons, thank you. Why
so is it? Because Japanese is all heathens, which
is not eligible to Christmas present. If Japanese
would obtain valuable presents on this date they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
must become Christians. This is too much trouble
to do. Is it not more better for Japanese Boy to
become Christian for Christmas-time and heathen
for all other purposes? Thank you, I will try.</p>

<p>All Japanese living as naybors to me enjoy
belief in Buddha with exception to Arthur Kickahajama
who is Methodist and W. Furo who believe
in Hon. Roosevelt. Hon. Rev. J. W. Chillworthy,
American missionary, desire to do something to
us heathen, so he look everywhere and find what
is necessary. He prepare large Xmas tree at
Asiatic M. E. Church and go around to all Japanese
Boys with tempting speeches. To me he
approach to say,</p>

<p>“Hon. Togo, do you wish to expect valuable
Christmas present to equal price of 25c?”</p>

<p>“Would this be cash-gifts or merchandise?”
I report.</p>

<p>“Merchandise of considerable merit, because
Christmas presents must be this,” command that
Chillworthy clergyman.</p>

<p>“I would accept such dry-goods,’ I commit.</p>

<p>“Very well. Then give me 25c money to collect,
please.”</p>

<p>“No thank you, Mr. Clergyman, not to do!
If Japanese Boy give 25c to collect, what graft
would this Christmas present be of value 25c?”
This question from me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span></p>

<p>“Togo, you are heathen, therefore blind. At
Christmas you will receive get-back of 25c to pay
for put-up of 25c which you now do. You will be
generous to give this price, I will be generous to
give it back. This will be Christmas Spirit and
keep money in circulation.”</p>

<p>So I deliver this quarter of dollar to Hon.
Chillworthy as price. As reward he invite me to
Christmas tree for persons of yellow extraction at
church where I will please to be, thank you.
All Japanese of S. F. has become Christians for
this date because free ice-cream will be served.</p>

<p>Last Christmas date Japanese Schoolboy was
very recently arrived to America. Therefore I did
not know about Christmas. My cousin Nogi reply
that this was annual good-will Peace Conference
ceremony. Persons having bricks, bottles, shoot-guns,
stick-knives and all other political convictions
must conceal these under mattrass, thank
you. Enemies must meet under kissletoe-vine for
sweet-heart conversation. Therefore I remove
all firearms, bricks, etc., from my clothing and go
out to sidewalk where I watch how Christians enjoy
this great festival.</p>

<p>I notice there large flocks of Christians bringing
earth-peace feeling together by drinking considerable
whisky. City is filled of sailors, plumbers,
hack-drivers and other patriots making side-step<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
to each saloon where more earth-peace is poured
in. Finally good-will become very energetic and
front of saloon is carried away by excitement.
Peace-on-earth continue to make more noisy riot
by each minute until pretty soonly police-gentleman
whistle for jailcart and all these Christians,
broken in several places but making splendid noise
with songs, is carried away to city lock-in.</p>

<p>Of course these is very wild Christians what
make such behaviour. It is more comfortable
to be tamer Christian and take Hon. Christmas
home to wife &amp; baby. Such persons get small
timber-tree from mountain and plant it in parlour
of home. (Some Christians have not got parlours,
so they need not feel responsible for Xmas trees.)
Branches of this tree is used to hang things on—glass,
tin-ware, clothing, groceries, candles or anything
else that is very cheap &amp; convenient. Then
alarm-clock is set to get-up family by lamp-light.
When joy-bell go off all retire to parlour to watch
Family Father set fire to Xmas tree by light of
candle.</p>

<p>All Christians enjoy Christmas with exception
of fire engine man who is too busy throwing water
on the insurance.</p>

<p>It is very hard duty to explain to Japanese
Infants about Santy Claus, that famous American
saint which so closely resemble Marquis Ito in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
foliage of his whiskers. These children enjoy
great mental struggles because of their heathen
parentage. Little Annie Anazuma, 9-year-age
daughter of I. Anazuma, Japanese barber, come
to me to enquire like this:</p>

<p>“Uncle Togo,” she resume, “to what extent
is this falsehood about that Hon. Santy Claus?”</p>

<p>“Little Annie,” I snuggest, “I speak you honest
truth, because you are one childish Japanese. I
do not believe this Santy Claus is such person.
Why? Because I suspect. Presents here, toys
there, books, albums, jumping-up-jacks, photo
supplies, sweet confectionary—all these scattered
with such immediate delivery all at once and
together—I suspect it can not be swallowed.
Where would this Santy Claus person obtain so
much moneys for give presents to all Christian
children, including small negroes? Do Congress
appropriate this price? Do Hon. Carnegie donate
it? Is Hon. Santy Claus working for U. S. Government
or some private corporation? I reply. If
he was working for U. S. Government he would
not get around so swift. If he was working for
some Trust he would not give nothing to nobody.
Therefore he is not.</p>

<p>“Japanese child, you are not insane to think.
Forget this tell-tale of American mothology. It
is too foolish to imagine this Mr. Claus dropping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
chocolate-creams down each chimney-pipe by
such wholesale.”</p>

<p>“No, Uncle Togo,” report this little Annie.
“It is well known fact that Christians never give
away presents in that sneak-dog manner.”</p>

<p>I shall buy chew-gum for this little Annie Anazuma
to eat for Hon. Christmas.</p>

<p>I am considerably sorrow for civilizedation when
I make thoughts about this Santy Claus affair.
Does not American missionary say to Japanese
Boy, “Thou shan’t not lie?” Why then is this
lying-instruction given to American children?
Hon. Geo. Washington was disgusted to tell a liar.
Hon. Roosevelt enjoys faintness after entertaining
such persons. He has frequently spoken to
Congress about this habit which they enjoy.
Why, then, does American gentleman donate
presents to baby and lay all blame for the affair to
Santy Claus. Is it not cowardly to get out of it
in this way?</p>

<p>When American gentleman give Christmas
present to wife he does not blame it to Santy Claus
because those lady is too smart to believe such
talk. Therefore he must confess that he done it
himself.</p>

<p>In getting civilized all over herself must Japan
do this Hon. Christmas also? I do not require
this, because many Christmas customs is not best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
good for all human races. Therefore Japan can
get along more quicker without Hon. Christmas,
which comes only once annually, but stays long
time.</p>

<p>To what use is it, I will please inquire, to give
Japan Baby jump-up-jack, toy shoot-gun, little
squeak-dog? Would it not be more improving to
his tiny brain-thoughts to present him with
History-books, electrical apparatus, etc.? Is
Mother Geese sing-song book of more knowledge
to kindergarten intelligence as some happy treatise
for Japanese children like “How to Build a Navy
in 15 Lessons?” I enquire.</p>

<p>Also this. American young persons employ
their Christmas holiday for make careless amusements
like turkey-eat, merrying and flirtating.
Would it not be more healthy for their souls if
following program was served for Christmas?</p>

<p>8 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>—Get up for Sunday clothes.</p>

<p>8.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>—Light breakfast of rice &amp; water.</p>

<p>9.00 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>—practise prize-fighting, feetball &amp;
other simple gymnastus.</p>

<p>9.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>—attend lecture on Art, Music &amp;
Shorthand.</p>

<p>10.30 <span class="allsmcap">A. M.</span>—read together from works of John
Greenleaf Whittier and relate 6 humoristick anecdotes
of Hon. Mark Twain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Noon</span>—Vegetarian refreshments &amp; light nap till</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span></p>

<p>2 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—Mass meeting of all nationalities to
discuss Universal Peace.</p>

<p>5 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—Tea ceremony at residence of some
rich person.</p>

<p>7 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—Dinner of fish, pickled turnips &amp;
other holiday foods.</p>

<p>8.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—Attend performance of Ben Hur.</p>

<p>10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P. M.</span>—Retire after sending out Mary
Christmas cards to all friends.</p>

<p>This kind of Christmas enjoyment would make
all Christians more healthy. For Christmas present
they would give valuable advice and receive
choice instruction as come-back. Foreign Americans
which now make peace-on-earth by whisky-drinking
would not do so. By eating Japanese
food all would escape digestion which now makes
so many angry groans in bed. Infants &amp; babies
would not be faked to by Santy Claus. Fire-engine
man would hitch horse and attend lectures,
because there would not be no Christmas trees
to burn down the insurance. Professors would
have fine time talking and all would be obliged to
listen. This would be very cheap and natural
for each human race.</p>

<p>Whenever I am talked to of giving something to
merry Christmas people I tell following Japanese
mothology:</p>

<p>In Kyoto, about 12007 B. C., there reside a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
notorious Poet name of Washu who remain there
tranquilly, enjoying blessings of great poverty,
thank you. Governing this city there was a gentleman
name of Hon. Mamayuki who was celebrated
for stingyness and other virtues. On New Year
day, time of Japanese Christmas-present, poet
Washu send to Hon. Mamayuki following rhythm:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dear sir, heaven knows you are serene like the stars—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore do you remember Poets now and then?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Washu, the Poet, have sang songs for your benefit several administrations,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">He have handed out tributes to your handsome of face, good-clothes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not forgetting praise of babies belonging to your several Hon. wives;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Also Washu has been regardless about speaking of your generosity.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore, Commander of Heaven and Earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it not</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">About time</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">That you make trifling Christmas-reward to the celebrated sing-songer Washu?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I bow down, strike forehead and request reply by return mail.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hon. Mamayuki, soon as he receive this poetical
rhythm, go to barnyard of Palace and there choose
one camel-horse celebrated for hungry appetite.
This brutal beast Hon. Mamayuki capture and
send to Hon. Washu with following words:</p>

<p>“Little Gift to reward great Poet. Mary
Christmas!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span></p>

<p>Hon. Washu see this camel-horse and weep
thoughtfully. Poets is not given credit for groceries
in Japan—so how to feed this menagerie
which was no use to Mr. Washu’s profession?
Yet it would not be safe for his neck to sell or give
away present sent by Gov. of Kyoto. Even while
weeping this poetical Japanese embrace that camel
pet with one glad thought: Camel-horses is different
from plain beasts, because they only needs
to eat and drink once time eech month!</p>

<p>“This is great economy for Japanese Poet,”
make Washu in brain-thoughts.</p>

<p>But when 1st day of next month come by
them brutal animal begin complaining for lunch.
Washu enjoy painful thought—but he is brave
Samurai. So he lead this camel-pet to kitchen
where greatest poverty ensues. “All which I have
here you are welcome to and much obliged,” he
say to camel-pet. So he bring out 6 pounds rice,
72 pancakes, 14 packages tea, 2 bales straw, 9
yards matting from floor—all these delecatessance
which camel-horse devour making lip-smack and
other sounds of great thirst. Now at that time
there was big drouth in Kyoto and water was very
expensive, thank you. But this poetical Washu buy
three barrel of water for that camel-horse at price
of 2 yen per quart. But camel-pet continue making
rusty sounds of voice to request more, please.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span></p>

<p>At last when this hon. brute begin to eat paper
from walls Washu feed him shoes &amp; straw hat and
commit hari-kiri after delivering following invitation
to Mamayuki, Gov. of Kyoto:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dear sir, when next you present Camel to one poor Japanese</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Please provide pension with which to pay board for this Zoo;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For is it just to donate Palace to gentleman who cannot afford to pay for lawn-sprinkler?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is it generous to endow poverty-persons with ottomobiles when they have not got nothing to buy no gasolene with?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Flour, potatoes, beefsteak,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">But since Camel came</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I have felt White Elephant on fingers.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Therefore Washu the Poet</div>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Editor, I am going to be
Christian on Dec. 25, so as to get back them 25c
which Hon. Rev. Chillworthy has took. But
I am going to eat like heathen, think like
heathen, act like heathen, so that everything about
me shall remain in good-healthy condition for 4th
of July, when it is unnecessary to be a Christian,
thank you. Hoping you get for Christmas present
what is coming to you,</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ANNUAL NEW YEAR</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">San Francisco</span>, December 28th.</p>

<p class="hanging"><i>To celebrated newspaper printers, New York
City, etc.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dearest Sirs</span>—We are about to put away this
1908th year, thank you, because it is considerably
used up. How many kind thoughts of neighbours,
young ladies, labouring unions, sickness, food &amp;
drunk, poems of Hon. Mr. Byron, etc., come to
this Japanese Schoolboy for sentimental intelligence
to celebrate! O my, so soon this year have
went! So short of time for 365 days, so full of
everything what has happened to people! How
can I speak for tears of voice? O happy date of
Jan. 1st! Persons which are sorry for what they
done on Christmas can now forget it by turning
over and over: Give ring-off to old, give ring-on
to new!</p>

<p>During this so happy annual that is past many
National Events has happened to me. Brick-bat
wound sent by labouring union has swole up,
thank you, enjoying some agony; Miss Furioki
which married cousin Nogi loves me so little; C. W.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
Kurashuke, Japanese dentistry, operate on my
toothache which I shall never pay for; Arthur
Kickahajama, missionary boy, ruin the beauty of
my derby hat by wearing it; I must suicide myself
to hari-kiri on account of O-Fido who create
expense &amp; only wag about it; I have acquired a
feetwet by searching for employment which brings
me the result of great influenza and sneezing in
hon. nose. All these blessings make Japanese
Boy forgiving to turn over new leap-year.</p>

<p>I enjoy suspicious sensation, Mr. Editor. What
make all-world persons so happy about New Year
day arriving less? Because so. Persons say secretly
in sinful brain-thoughts: “That last annual year
were disappointing, thank you. It was good year
when first made, but considerably decomposed by
various gentlemans who was to blame. Hon.
Roosevelt spoil this year with muddy feet-kicks,
Hon. Rockefeller ruin it by robbery &amp; prayer,
Hon. Lawson make it sad with considerable foolish
wisdom. This year may go chase itself, please,
if convenient. By next New Year time we
shall not enjoy so many curses. All world shall
love itself and so on. Japanese shall join hands
with Irish and population mix-up. Bankers,
divorces, house-flies, and other grafts shall be
prohibited by poisoning them. Therefore let us
order another drunk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span></p>

<p>“Of what value is this New Year time to Japanese
persons?” I compel of cousin Nogi when I call
to borrow 10 cents, price of Japanese cigarettes.</p>

<p>“For this,” exaggerate Nogi, “because is.”</p>

<p>“Tell me to know, please how?” I exhibit.</p>

<p>“Togo,” cry Nogi, “New Year is for getting rid
of sin. You have some expensive sin which you
keep around—shampane, high-food, silk derby—New
Year fine time to make swear-off of this.”</p>

<p>“I am ridiculous to laugh,” I commit, “what
expensive sin I swear-off, please? I am enjoying
too much poverty to be able not to get
along without nothing which I haven’t not got,
have I?”</p>

<p>“One expensive sin you have got which you
might resolution to get away from,” magnify this
Nogi, “you are educated to cigarette-smoking.
Swear-off, please. Therefore I will not loaned you
them 10c you ask for to have.”</p>

<p>Since these conversation I have not called to
Nogi or Miss Furioki which he married himself to.
Nogi has got one jiu-jitsu comeing to him.</p>

<p>However yet, if I am sinful, I shall make some
fine resolutions to give up many things which I
have not got. But before doing so I shall be
thankful to supply for you following review of
National Events which has happened to this kingdom
for year 1908th:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span></p>

<p><i>Panama Canal</i>—This will be completed as
soon as begun. No mosquitos.</p>

<p><i>Politicks</i>—Hon. Roosevelt will not be doing
so much longer. This kingdom have already
chosen which Democratic president will not be
elected.</p>

<p><i>Warfare</i>—I do not know about this. America
fleet is out hunting for it.</p>

<p><i>Education</i>—Hon. Mark Twain is made laughing
professor of Oxford, home for English schoolboys.
Humoristick anecdote of that great man
was enjoyed by all and understood by some.</p>

<p><i>Literature &amp; Art</i>—Much is being done in this
line, but very little accomplished.</p>

<p><i>Socialism</i>—This talk is spoken in many languages
and require much brain-thought. Some
delightful speaker say:</p>

<p>“All men are equal.” “Equal to what?” is
question from Japanese Boy.</p>

<p><i>Business</i>—This is pretty hard to do just at
presently.</p>

<p><i>Athleticks</i>—A game of feetball was played
between Yale &amp; Harvard this year to celebrate
the Battle of Waterloo. Both sides won except
Yale, which didn’t. This is fine exercise for
young students which does not care for death by
book-study.</p>

<p><i>Real Estate</i>—Everywhere good corner lots can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
be had for prices asked. Skyscrape buildings is
acting very valuable. Some empty lots still continues
to remain in Canada and suburbs of
Nebraska. J. Furo, Japanese hardware, who is
dead, is renting second story of store to O.
Jiijuwaki, Japanese undertaker.</p>

<p class="tb">Mr. Editor, because you are conductor of great
newspaper I desire let you have some news which
will surprise you. It happen in Japan 2016 years
formerly. Following is it:</p>

<p>During that year I say about there reside in
Hokadate, Japan, very sweet singer name of Obi
Obi. In order to keep him in good voice for songs,
which he could sang like nightinglory-bird, this
man was oblige to take considerable rice brandy
by each evening. Then he would sing pretty fine till
stopped by friends and police. He continue this exercise
for several years and never get tired out of it.</p>

<p>Come time to Happy New Years on the day
before is. Obi Obi declare: “To-morrow will
be January One on which all good Japanese are
respected to reform theirselves. Therefore tonight
must be the night.”</p>

<p>So Obi Obi order to house large kag-barrel of
rice whiskey, together with many friends to hear
concert. After 2 qts of these was drunken up Obi
Obi sing very fine from Japanese opera. Friends<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
applause for more and decry: “Too sorry this
music-song must be stopped up to-morrow which
is swear-off New Years!”</p>

<p>When midnight time arrive, Obi Obi, too tired
to sing no more, so he fall to slumber under table
and this he dream:</p>

<p>He dream that Angel of Dying drop to him out of
sky and carry under wing one large literary Book.</p>

<p>“Obi Obi,” she command, “these here Book
is that Life which you been leading around this
several years.”</p>

<p>“My sakes!” commute this Obi Obi, “what
disgusting literary job of writing is put down on
them pages—such blots and woggly-letters
with swear-and-tear places all over it! Who wrote
them disgusting records of life, please Mr. Angel?”</p>

<p>“Obi Obi, sweet singer, it was <i>you</i> that done it
all these years you have been songing and whiskey-drunking,”
devour that lovely Angel.</p>

<p>“Then I must have enjoyed great wickedness to
have wrote my lifetime so badly,” retort that great
man.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have so,” say Angel. “You are
therefore to die and go to boiling-point on this New
Year day—come, please.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hon. Angel, one more chance for
Obi Obi, be so kind!”</p>

<p>“Very well, once more chance,” say spirited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
Angel. “If you can wrote in these Book one page
of neat-writing, Spencerian book-keep handwrite,
no blotting-marks, then you may die and go
Heaven.”</p>

<p>“Thank you to do!” say Obi Obi, &amp; took fountind
pen &amp; wrote once more page in Book of Life.
But when done—O such bad disgust! That
page was all blotty-marked with woggly ink-splatter
letters and orthography.</p>

<p>“There!” say Angel, “you have wrote new leaf
on New Year day, and see! It is worse job as
formerly. Come, please, and die.”</p>

<p>Obi Obi look at page and say this following
philosophy:</p>

<p>“The reason why so I write it so bumly in Book
of Life is not because of me, but because of bad
pen and ink provided.”</p>

<p>Then he wake up with head-split and throat-crack
symbols of drunkenness. He make groaning
sound and O Yucha San, wife of his, approach
with that delicious ice-water.</p>

<p>“It is Happy New Year!” she relate, making
smiles.</p>

<p>“Thank you for telling me so it is,” say Obi Obi.
Then he went dead.</p>

<p>And them dying words is to be saw on tomb
which you may visit there to-day, price two sen
admission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span></p>

<p>Please to listen what I do with tipewriting last
night:</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
